/*
 ** NAME
 **      _adj_snow -- adjust the snowcover with changes in depth and/or mass
 **
 ** SYNOPSIS
 **      #include "_snobal.h"
 **
 **      void
 **	_adj_snow(
 **	    double delta_z_s,	|* change in snowcover's depth *|
 **	    double delta_m_s)	|* change is snowcover's mass *|
 **
 ** DESCRIPTION
 **      This routine adjusts the snowcover for a change in its depth or
 **	its mass or both.  The snowcover's density is updated.  If there
 **	is a change in the snowcover's depth, the # of layers is recomputed.
 **	If there's just a change in the snowcover's mass with no change in
 **	its depth, then just the specific masses for the layers are updated.
 **
 **	The routine ensures that the snowcover's density does NOT exceed
 **	a maximum density (currently 750 kg/m^3).  If the adjustments to
 **	the snowcover, for some reason, lead to an excessive density, the
 **	density is clipped at the maximum, and the depth re-adjusted
 **	accordingly.
 **
 ** GLOBAL VARIABLES READ
 **
 ** GLOBAL VARIABLES MODIFIED
 **	m_s
 **	rho
 **	z_s
 **
 **	(and those variables modified by "_adj_layers" and "_layer_mass")
