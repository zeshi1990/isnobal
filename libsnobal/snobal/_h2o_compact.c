/*
 ** NAME
 **      _h2o_compact -- compact snowcover due to liquid H2O that was added
 **
 ** SYNOPSIS
 **      #include "_snobal.h"
 **
 **      void
 **	_h2o_compact(void)
 **
 ** DESCRIPTION
 **	This routine compacts or densifies the snowcover based on the
 **	amount of liquid H2O that was added to the snowcover from melting
 **	and rain.  The snowcover's density is increased using the
 **	following "half-saturation" function:
 **
 **		delta_rho(h2o_added) = A / (1 + B/h2o_added)
 **
 **	A = "saturation-level" or asymtope which is the difference between
 **	    the maximum density due to compaction by liquid H2O
 **	    (approximately 550 kg/m^2) and the current density
 **	B = the point for half of the saturation level is reached (5 %)
 **	    (h2o_added = ratio of mass of liquid h2o added by melting and
 **		         rain to the mass of the snowcover)
