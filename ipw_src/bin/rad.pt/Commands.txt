Radiation Modeling: Point

  solar     - exoatmospheric direct solar irradiance
  sunang    - sun angles: azimuth and zenith angles of sun's position
  sunlight  - sunrise and sunset times, and quadrature weights
  twostream - two-stream radiative transfer model of a homogeneous layer
  thermin   - incoming thermal radiation at different elevations
  trad      - incoming thermal radiation at one elevation
  cloud     - estimate cloudcover from tmax, tmin
  solar_can - compute below canopy solar radiation (Mel's model)
  trad_can  - compute below canopy thermal radiation (Mel's model)
