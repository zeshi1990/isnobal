.ft CR
\fBsolar\fP [ \fB-w\fP \fIum\fP[,\fIum2\fP] ] [ \fB-d\fP \fIyear\fP,\fImonth\fP,\fIday\fP ] [ \fB-a\fP ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Solar calculates exoatmospheric direct \fBsolar\fP irradiance.  If two
arguments to \fB-w are given, the integral of \fBsolar\fP irradiance over
the range will be calculated.  If one argument is given, the
spectral irradiance will be calculated.
.PP
If no wavelengths are specified on the command line, single
wavelengths in um will be read from the standard input and the
spectral irradiance calculated for each.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-w\fP \fIum\fP[,\fIum2\fP]
If two arguments are given, the integral of \fBsolar\fP irradiance
in the range \fIum\fP to \fIum2\fP will be calculated.  If one
argument is given, the spectral irradiance will be calculated.
If no arguments are given, single wavelengths will be read
from the standard input.
.sp
.TP
\fB-d\fP \fIyear\fP,\fImonth\fP,\fIday\fP
The date is \fIyear\fP, \fImonth\fP, \fIday\fP.  This is used to
calculate the \fBsolar\fP radius vector which divides the result.
If no date is given, the \fBsolar\fP radius vector is taken as 1.
