\fBcmpimg\fP - compare two IPW images
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
\fBcmpimg\fP \fIimage1 image2\fP
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBcmpimg\fP compares the pixel data from \fIimage1\fP and \fIimage2\fP, ignoring
any headers.  A "-" in place of an image represents the standard
input.  The output of \fBcmpimg\fP is a message printed to the standard
output indicating whether the two input images differ or are
identical.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP

.SH OPERANDS

\fIimage1 image2\fP
input images to be compared
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following sequence might be used to test a command, such as
transpose, that should be its own inverse:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	transpose image | transpose | cmpimg - image
.ft R
.fi
.SH FILES
.PP
None.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
None.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
\fBcmpimg\fP is implemented as a shell script that invokes the UNIX
\fBcmp\fP command.  Since \fBcmp\fP has no notion of image structure,
\fBcmpimg\fP gives no
indication of the logical image locations (line, sample, band)
where differences occur.
.PP
The exit status of \fBcmpimg\fP does NOT indicate the result.
