.SH NAME
.PP
\fBadvec\fP - advected energy for a snowcover
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
\fBadvec\fP [ \fB-r\fP ] [ \fB-K\fP ]
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBadvec\fP is one of a group of commands designed to simulate energy,
climate, or hydrologic processes or properties at a point.
Most were originally written as "qdips" (Quick and Dirty Image
Processing System) programs by D. Marks, during the 1980's at UCSB.
.PP
\fBadvec\fP calculates the advected energy for a snowcover from
inputs on precipitation density, depth, temperature,
and snow surface temperature.
.PP
Input is from standard input;
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
         rho, zp, tp, ts

         rho = precipitation density (kg/m^3)
         zp  = precipitation depth (m)
         tp  = precipitation temperature (C)
         ts  = snow temperature (C)
.ft R
.fi

.PP
Output is advected heat (J), and specific heat of precipitation.
Output to standard output.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-r\fP
precipitation is rain (default: snow)
.sp
.TP
\fB-K\fP
input temperatures are in K (default: C)
.SH OPERANDS
.PP
None
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To calculate advection caused by 10mm of 2 deg rain on 0 deg snow:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	echo "1000 .01 2.0 0.0" | advec -r
yields:
        advection     specific heat
        84252.00      4212.60
.ft R
.fi

.PP
To calculate advection caused by 40cm of -8 deg, 150kg/m^3 snow on -2 deg snow:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
        echo "150 .4 -8.0 -2.0" | advec -r
yields:
        advection     specific heat
        -1525716.00   4238.10
