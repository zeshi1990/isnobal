.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBsnowmass\fP is a simple radiation based daily snowmelt model.  It
reads from standard input; each line should have:
.PP

.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	solar thermal Tmax Tmin dpt pcp lai elev u dt intrcpt
.ft R
.fi

.PP
where:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	solar   = total daily solar incidence at top of canopy (J)
	thermal = total daily thermal irradiance at forest floor (J)
	Tmax    = daily maximum air temperature (C)
	Tmin    = minimum daily air temperature (C)
	dpt     = dewpoint temperature (C)
	lai     = leaf area index (1 sided)
	elev    = site elevation (m)
	u       = mean daily wind speed (m/s)
	dt      = time period of Solin data (hrs)
	intrcpt = pcp intercept. coeff. (m/lai)
	          (default: -1=0.001m lai^-1)

.PP
sublimation and melt only occurs during the day; if wind speed is zero
then wind is parameterized between 0.1m for full forest cover and 1.5m/s
for open areas. Penman-Monteith method used to sublimate snow.
