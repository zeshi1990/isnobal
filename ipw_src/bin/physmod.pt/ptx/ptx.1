\fBptx\fP - potential evaporation (PE) using simplified Priestly-Taylor method

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBptx\fP calculates LE flux using a simplified Priestly-Taylor
approach. This method is designed to estimate the total
evaporative flux over a wet surface using only air temperature
radiation, and the Priestly-Taylor coef.  The LE flux is
representative of potential evaporation (PE).
.PP
Assumptions:
.PP
G is 10% of Rn; Surface is saturated and le due to turbulent
vapor flux is minimal and well correlated with Rn. This
assumption works well over short canopies (grass) but
not over forested canopies (\fIMcNaughton and Black, 1973\fP;
\fIPriestley and Taylor, 1972\fP).
The program is designed to
be driven from daily data, and reads input from a file or from stdin:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
        Rn, ta, PP
.ft R
.fi

.sp
.nf
.ft CR
        Rn    = Net radiation (negative away from surface)
        ta    = Air temperature (C)
        PP    = Priestly Taylor Parameter (approx 1.26)
.ft R
.fi

.PP
PP can be set to the standard value (1.26), or calculated using the method
described by \fIPereira and Nova (1992)\fP.
.PP
Output is to stdout.
