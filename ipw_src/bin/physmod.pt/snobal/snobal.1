.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBsnobal\fP is an
interactive point model using the energy balance to calculate
snowmelt, and to predict runoff, from input data on
snow properties, measurement heights & depths, and energy
exchanges.  Similar to the approach used by \fIAnderson (1976)\fP,
and \fIMorris (1982)\fP, but designed to run on simpler,
more generalizable inputs.
The model was first presented by \fIMarks (1988)\fP,
described conceptually by \fIMarks, et. al (1992)\fP and
\fIMarks and Dozier (1992)\fP, and then described in great detail
by \fIMarks, et. al (1997)\fP.
.PP
The model approximates the snow cover as being composed of
two layers, a surface fixed-thickness active layer and a
lower layer, solving for the temperature (C) and specific
mass (kg/m^2) or mass per unit area (from density * depth
(kg/m^3 * m)) for each, and computing total snowcover temperature
and specific mass from these.
.PP
Melt is computed in either layer when the accumulated energy
exceeds the "cold content" or when the "cold content"
is > 0.0.  Cold content is the energy required to bring the snow
cover temperature up to freezing (0 C).  Runoff is estimated
when the accumulated melt and liquid H2O content exceed a
specified threshold.
Model assumes a soil thermal conductivity that was derived from
heat flux data collected at the ARS Reynolds Creek RMSP site, which
approximates a moist sandy soil.
.PP
This version of the model was designed for detailed point
simulations to test conditions and data for setting up the
spatial, topographically distributed version of the model:
isnobal.
.PP
Inputs:
.PP
Input data are specified for the snow properties and the
measurement heights and depths.  Each set of data must have
at least one record; this required record defines the initial
conditions for the model run.  Any subsequent optional
records are treated as update/verification data, and are
used to reset the snow properties and measurement heights
and depths.  These records are also used to determine the
model error for the snow properties.  These inputs can all
come from input text files, or the model will prompt the
user for them at the start of and during the model run.  The
records must be specified in chronological order.
.PP
snow properties record format:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     time_s    =   time since start (decimal hrs) (first
                   entry is model run's start time)
     z_s       =   total snowcover depth (m)
     rho       =   average snowcover density (kg/m^3)
     T_s_0     =   active snow layer temperature (C)
     T_s       =   average snowcover temperature (C)
     h2o_sat   =   % of liquid H2O saturation (relative
                   water content, i.e., ratio of water in
                   snowcover to water that snowcover could
                   hold at saturation)
.ft R

.PP
measurement heights & depths record format:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     time_z   =   time since start (decimal hrs) (first entry must
                  match time_s in first entry of snow properties)
     z_u      =   height above the ground of wind speed measurement (m)
     z_T      =   height above the ground of air temperature and vapor
                  pressure measurement (m) (z_u can equal z_T)
     z_0      =   roughness length (m) (for snow: 0.01 to 0.0001)
     z_g      =   depth of soil-temperature measurement (m) (0 to 1.0)
.ft R
.fi

.PP
Optional precipitation data can be provided as input to the
model.  These data are used to calculate advected heat from
the precipitation (snow or rain or both) and to update the
specific mass of the snow cover.  Rain either becomes runoff
(if there is little or no snow) or is added to the liquid
water content.
.PP
Like the records for the snow properties and measurement
heights, the precipitation records must be in chronological
order.
.PP
precipitation record format:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     time_pp    =   time since start (decimal hrs) (first
                    entry must be >= start time)
     m_pp       =   total precip. mass (kg/m^2)
     %_snow     =   % of precip. mass that was snow (0 to 1.0)
     rho_snow   =   density of snowfall (kg/m^3)
     T_pp       =   average precip. temperature (C) (from dew
                    point temperature if available, or can be
                    estimated from air temperature during
                    storm, or minimum daily temperature)
.ft R
.fi

.PP
The model will parse mixed rain/snow events.  It is designed
to accept inputs that could be derived from typical NRCS
Snotel data such as total precipitation, snow mass increase,
and temperature.  The user must estimate average density and
percent snow if depth data are unavailable.  The model makes
the following assumptions about the snow temperature, rain
temperature, and liquid water saturation of the snow:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     when 0.0 < %_snow < 1.0, (a mixed rain/snow event)
          snow temperature = 0.0
          rain temperature = T_pp
          liquid H2O sat.  = 100%

     when %_snow = 1.0 and T_pp => 0.0, (a warm snow-only event)
          snow temperature = 0.0
          liquid H2O sat.  = 100%

     when %_snow = 1.0 and T_pp < 0.0, (a cold snow event)
          snow temperature = T_pp
          liquid H2O sat.  = 0%
.ft R

Input records of certain climate parameters are required to
drive the model.  These records are read from either an
input file or standard input.

     S_n    =   net solar radiation (W/m^2)
     I_lw   =   incoming thermal (longwave) radiation (W/m^2)
     T_a    =   air temperature (C)
     e_a    =   vapor pressure (Pa)
     u      =   wind speed (m/sec)
     T_g    =   soil temperature (C)
     [ro]   =   specific discharge/runoff (m/sec) (may be omitted)
.ft R
.fi

.PP
Time Steps (data timestep and run timesteps):
.PP
The "data timestep" is the time interval between the input
records of climate data.  The model assumes that this interval
is constant.  Because the snowcover energy balance is
very sensitive to diurnal variations in climate (radiation,
temperature, etc.), the "data timestep" must be 360 minutes
(6 hours) or less.  Best results are achieved with a data
timestep of 180 minutes (3 hours) or less.  Data timesteps
greater than 60 minutes must be multiples of whole hours
(e.g., 120 minutes, or 180 minutes).
.PP
A "run timestep" is the internal timestep that the model
actually runs at.  Because input values are assumed to be
averages over a run timestep, it is always 60 minutes (1
hour) or less to insure a stable model solution.  Solution
instabilities occur when the run timestep is too long to
account for rapid changes in the EB (eg.  sun rise or sunset),
or when a layer's mass is too small to accommodate the
assumption of an average flux over the run timestep.
.PP
There are 3 lengths of run timesteps: "normal, medium, and
small".  By default, the model uses the normal run timestep
which is the longest of the three run timesteps.  The normal
timestep must divide evenly into the data timestep (i.e.,
the data timestep is an integer multiple of the normal run
timestep).  The input data for a normal run timestep (climate
data and some precipitation values) are computed from
the input records by linear interpolation.
.PP
The shorter run timesteps (medium and small) are only used
as a layer's mass diminishes to further insure solution stability.
When either layer's mass drops below a specified
threshold, the model divides a larger run timestep into
shorter run timesteps (e.g., divides a normal run timestep
into medium run timesteps).  There are three mass thresholds;
one for each run timestep: normal, medium, and small.
When a layer's mass falls below the threshold for the the
small run timestep, the model removes the layer.
.PP
Just as the normal run timestep divides evenly into the data
timestep, each of the two shorter run timesteps must divide
evenly into the next larger run timestep (medium into normal,
small into medium).  And like the normal timesteps, the
input data for medium and small timesteps are linearly
interpolated from the input records.

The model writes output records to either an output file or
standard output.
