.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBbowvap\fP is one of a group of commands designed to simulate energy,
climate, or hydrologic processes or properties at a point.
Most were originally written as "qdips" (Quick and Dirty Image
Processing System) programs by D. Marks, during the 1980's at UCSB.
.PP
\fBbowvap\fP calculates evaporation rate using \fIBowen (1926)\fP
ratio approach;
Output is rate in kg/(sec m**2) which is specific discharge
in mm/sec;
Reads input file from stdin of form:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	ts, ta, ea, snet, advec, store, time
.ft R
.fi
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	where:
		ts     = surface temperature (C)
		ta     = air temperature (C)
		ea     = vapor pressure (Pa)
		snet   = net solar radiation (W/m**2)
		advec  = energy from advection (W/m**2)
		store  = change in energy storage (W/m**2)
		time   = time since last meas. (hrs)

.PP
Sea Level (0.0 m) is default unless z is set;
Standard atmospheric pressure (101324.6 Pa) is default
unless pa is set;
If z is set and pa is not, pa is calculated from z;
If pa is set and z is not, z is roughly estimated from pa;
View factor of 1.0 is default unless vf is set;
Environmental lapse rate of -0.0065 deg/m is default unless
lapse is set;
If tstep is set, then time step is assumed constant,
and time is not read from stdin;
Tstep should be set in decimal hours;
.PP
Surface emissivity of 1.0 is assumed;
Storage and advection may be ignored by setting them to 0.0;
.PP
Output to stdout;

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To calculate evaporation at an open site over snow at 1200m from hourly data
on air and surface temperature, net radiaiton, advection, and energy
storage:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	bowvap -z 1200 -t 1.0
        Input ts,   ta,  ea, snet, advec, store;
              -0.03 -0.2 601 0.0   2.2    -9.8
yields:
        rate = -2.141907e-08; total = -0.00008;
