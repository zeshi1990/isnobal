.SH NAME
.PP
\fBpenmanx\fP - latent heat flux (LE) using Penman-Monteith method
.SH SYNOPSIS

.ft CR
\fBpenmanx\fP [\fI <infile \fP]\fI \fP[\fI >outfile \fP]
.ft R

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBpenmanx\fP calculates LE flux (W/m2, +/-) using a detailed form of
the Penman-Monteith combination approach.
(see: \fIPenman, 1948; Monteith and Unsworth, 1990\fP).
.PP
Negative(-) LE fluxes are
designated away from the surface while positive fluxes(+) are designated
toward the surface. Inputs are as follows:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	ts, ta, ea, u, Rn, G, z0, z, rc
.ft R
.fi

.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	ts     = surface temperature (C)
	ta     = air temperature  (C)
	ea     =  actual vapor pressure at ta (Pa)
	u      = wind speed (m/s)
	Rn     = net radiation (W/m2, +/-)
	G      = surface heat flux (W/m2, +/-)
	z0     = surface roughness (m)
	z      = measurement height above the surface (m)
	rc     = canopy resistance (s/m) (0 for free water surface)

.PP
Outputs are latent heat flux (LE) (W/m^2), ratio of the portion of LE due to
radiation term over the portion of LE due to aerodynamic term (RATIO) (W/m^2),
portion of LE due to radiation term (RAD) (W/m^2), portion of LE due to
aerodynamic term (VPD) (W/m^2), aerodynamic resistance (Ra) (s/m), bulk
Richardson number (Rib), and stability function (F) (unitless).
Output to stdout.
