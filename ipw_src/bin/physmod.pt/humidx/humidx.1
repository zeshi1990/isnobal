\fBhumidx\fP - mean daily vapor pressure from min & max air temperatures
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBhumidx\fP [\fI <infile \fP]\fI \fP[\fI >outfile \fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBhumidx\fP calculates mean daily vapor pressure using minimum daily air
temperature as a surrogate for mean daily dew point.
Estimated vapor pressure is adjusted using an aridity index
derived from \fIPriestley-Taylor (1972)\fP, daily ET estimates and
annual precipitation.
The program reads input from a file or from stdin:
.sp

.ft CR
	Rn, tx, tn, daylen, pcp, PcpYR,
.ft R
.fi

.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	Rn	= Net radiation (W/m2)
	tx	= Maximum 24hr air temperature (C)
	tn	= Minimum 24hr air temperature (C)
	daylen	= length of daylight (s)
	pcp	= daily precipitation (mm)
	PcpYR	= Annual precipitation for site (mm)

Output is to stdout.
Use Daily data

Assumptions:
.PP
G is 10% of Rn; Priestley-Taylor parameter=1.26
(Priestley and Taylor 1972). If daily pcp>0.0
tn=dewpoint.
.PP
recommended for arid and semi-arid areas where differences
between dewpoint and Tn are generally large
(see \fIKimball et al. 1997\fP).
