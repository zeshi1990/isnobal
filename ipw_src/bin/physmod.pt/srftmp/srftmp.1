.SH NAME
.PP
\fBsrftmp\fP - soil surface temperature from min & max air temperatures
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBsrftmp\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBsrftmp\fP calculates surface temperature using a sin-wave
function where the amplitude of the wave is computed
as the difference between the maximum and minimum
daily air temperature and the mean is the average
surface temperature. Program was designed to compute
surface temperatures at 1,3, or 6 hour intervals
based on daily temperature information readily
available from surface climate station data.
See \fIJury et al.; Soil Physics, p. 185; 1991\fP.
.PP
Reads input file from stdin:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
             Tmax, Tmin, Tavg, P, lag, t
.ft R
.fi

.PP
where:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
          Tmax    = maximum daily air temp. (C)
          Tmin    = minimum daily air temp. (C)
          Tavg    = average surface temp. (C)
          P       = wave period (hrs; should be =24 for daily cycle)
          lag     = time of maximum temperature
          t       = time period of interest (hrs)

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To estimate temperature at 10PM (22.00 hrs), when:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
           Tmax    = 12,
           Tmin    = 3,
           Tave    = 6,
           P       = 24,
           lag     = 16 (4PM),
           t       = 22 (10PM):
