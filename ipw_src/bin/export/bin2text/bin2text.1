.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBbin2text\fP reads binary integers from \fIfile\fP (default: standard input) and
writes either text equivalents to the standard output.  If more

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To print the first 100 quantized pixel values from an IPW image
with 2-byte pixels:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     rmhdr | bin2text -2 | head -100
.ft R
.fi
.PP
Using ipwfile, the number of bytes can be determined automatically:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     rmhdr image | bin2text -`ipwfile -my image` | head -100
.ft R
.fi
