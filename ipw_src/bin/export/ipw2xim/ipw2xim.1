.SH NAME
.PP
\fBipw2xim\fP - convert IPW image to xim format
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
.ft CR
\fBipw2xim\fP [\fIimage\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBipw2xim\fP reads an IPW image (default: standard input) and writes it
it to the standard output in "xim" format.  An image in xim format
may be displayed in a X window by the xim or xxim commands.
.PP
Since xv and xloadimage support many more operations and formats
than the xim program, including modified versions of each that
support IPW images directly, \fBipw2xim\fP is archaic.  ipw2ppm will
convert images into the industry standard PPM format, including
support for color images.
