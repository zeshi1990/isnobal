.SH NAME
.PP
\fBipw2pbm\fP - convert IPW image to PGM or PPM formats
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
\fBipw2pbm\fP [\fI image \fP]
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBipw2pbm\fP reads \fIimage\fP (default: standard input) and writes its
equivalent to the standard output in either the PGM "portable graymap"
format (if \fIimage\fP has 1 band) or the PPM "portable pixmap" format (if
\fIimage\fP has 3 bands).
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
None
.SH OPERANDS
.TP
[\fI image \fP]
	image	1- or 3-band input image
.sp
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To display an IPW image using "xv" on an X window system display:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	ipw2pbm image | xv
.ft R
.fi

.PP
To display a 3-band IPW image as a color image using xli:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	mux red green blue | ipw2pbm | xli stdin
.ft R
.fi

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.TP
The following diagnostics indicate violations of restrictions imposed
by the PGM or PPM image formats:
.sp
.TP
\fInbits\fP-bit pixels (must be <= 8)
.br
	"raw"-format PGM or PPM images cannot have more than 8 bits
	per pixel
.sp
.TP
\fInbands\fP bands (must be either 1 or 3)
.br
	PGM images must have 1 band.  PPM images must have 3 bands.
.sp
.TP
pixel sizes differ: bands 0, \fIband\fP
.br
	All 3 bands in a PPM image must have the same number of bits
	per pixel.
