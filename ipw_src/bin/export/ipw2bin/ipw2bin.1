.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBipw2bin\fP [ \fB-m\fP \fImask\fP ] [ \fB-n\fP \fInodata\fP ] [\fIimage\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBipw2bin\fP reads values from \fIimage\fP (default: standard input) and
writes binary data in float format to the standard output.  The
image data may be masked with \fImask\fP.  The data is written in line
by sample order with no packing ( record length = #samples;
#records = #lines).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-m\fP \fImask\fP
Use \fImask\fP as a mask image.  Any points in \fImask\fP that are
0 will have the corresponding points in \fIimage\fP set to the
\fInodata\fP value.
.sp
.TP
\fB-n\fP \fInodata\fP
Points that are masked will be printed as the value \fInodata\fP
(default: 0.0).
.SH OPERANDS
.PP
None.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To export data to some packages such as PV-Wave, the line order must
be reversed since the origin is at the lower-left instead of the
upper left:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	flip -l image | binexp > image.dat
.ft R
.fi

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.TP
nodata value ignored without mask
.br
	The \fB-n option is only valid with a mask image.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
