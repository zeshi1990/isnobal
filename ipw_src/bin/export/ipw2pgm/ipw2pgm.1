.SH NAME
.PP
\fBipw2pgm\fP - convert IPW image to Portable Gray Map (PGM) image
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBipw2pgm\fP reads an IPW image and outputs a PGM image suitable for
processing by other image processing or image manipulation
packages.  The IPW data values are scaled to between 0 and 255
and then written as a PGM image.  For 1-byte IPW images, no
scaling is necessary and the program operates much faster.
.PP
The program ipw2ppm is a more general form of this program, but
can run significantly slower.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-v\fP
\fBipw2pgm\fP will print the dimensions of the image to the
standard error.
.sp
.TP
\fB-m\fP
Use \fImask\fP as a mask image.  Any points in \fImask\fP that are
0 will have the corresponding points in the output image
set to 0 (black).
