.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBswp\fP is one of a group of commands designed to simulate energy,
climate, or hydrologic processes or properties at a point.
Most were originally written as "qdips" (Quick and Dirty Image
Processing System) programs by D. Marks, during the 1980's at UCSB.
.PP
\fBswp\fP calculates soil water potential (SWP), and saturated and
unsaturated hydraulic conductivity from %sand, %clay,
and % soil water content (SWC) by volume.
Outputs SWP in kPa and hyd. cond in both m/s and cm/hr,
saturated SWP and hydraulic conductivity, and
water content ((m^3 h2o)/(m^3 of soil))*100 at 10 kPa, and at saturation.
