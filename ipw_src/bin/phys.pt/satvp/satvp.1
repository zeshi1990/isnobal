.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBsatvp\fP is one of a group of commands designed to simulate energy,
climate, or hydrologic processes or properties at a point.
Most were originally written as "qdips" (Quick and Dirty Image
Processing System) programs by D. Marks, during the 1980's at UCSB.
.PP
\fBsatvp\fP converts dew point temp to sat. vapor pressure
Reads dew point temp from standard input;
Dew point temp. input in C (default) or K;
Calculates vapor pressure in Pascals (default) or mb;
Output is to standard output;
.PP
(see \fIGeneral Meterology, Byers, 1974\fP)
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-K\fP
The input Dew point temperatures are in degrees K
(default: C).
.sp
.TP
\fB-m\fP
The output values for vapor pressure are in millibars.
(default: Pa).
