.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBwbt\fP is one of a group of commands designed to simulate energy,
climate, or hydrologic processes or properties at a point.
Most were originally written as "qdips" (Quick and Dirty Image
Processing System) programs by D. Marks, during the 1980's at UCSB.
.PP
\fBwbt\fP computes wet or ice bulb temperature from input values of
air temperature (C), and relative humidity(0 to 1.0) from a fixed site
air pressure(Pa), using Richard Essery's equations for the
psychrometric constant, its value at specific temperatures using the
Clausius-Clapeyron equation, and solves for the Tw or Ti
using the Newton-Raphson iterative approximation.
It returns wet or ice bulb temperture (C);
works at all temperatures (accounting for both fusion and vaporization).
<\\P>
.PP
Routine \fBwetbulb\fP is called to compute wet or ice bulb temperature from
values of air and dewpoint temperatures (K), and air pressure (Pa),
using Richard Essery's equations for the psychrometric constant,
its value at specific temperatures from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation,
and solves for the Tw or Ti using the Newton-Raphson iterative approximation.
It returns wet or ice bulb temperture (K);
works at all temperatures (accounting for both fusion and vaporization).
.PP
\fBwbt\fP reads air temperature and RH pairs from standard input;
Optional elevation, z, is used to calcualte air pressure;
Optional total air pressure (Pa); default is
sea level standard of 101324.6 Pa;
Optional output of dewpoint temp along with wet or ice bulb temp(C);
Output is to standard output;
