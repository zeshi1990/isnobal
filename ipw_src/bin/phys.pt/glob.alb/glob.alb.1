.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBglob.alb\fP is one of a group of commands designed to simulate energy,
climate, or hydrologic processes or properties at a point.
Most were originally written as "qdips" (Quick and Dirty Image
Processing System) programs by D. Marks, during the 1980's at UCSB.
.PP
First cut at estimating albedo changes with time and sun angle;
Estimates decay with time by approximating a a set of measured
values from two years of data from the Mammoth Mt. site;
Time decay curve approximated by a second order Chebyshev
polynomial (see routine decay());
Increase with zenith angle approximated with a simple
function of (1-cos(z)) in function diurnal();
Both give results that approximate measured values, and agree
with results in \fIChoudhury (1981)\fP, and \fIMcGuffie
and Henderson-Sellers (1985)\fP, both of which present an analysis
of the broad band albedo of snow in some detail;
.PP
Default n_alb is reasonable for new snow in mid season;
Higher values may be used in early season, and lower in melting
conditions; Default dkr is also a reasonable value for
mid season; smaller values may be used in early season, and
larger during melting conditions;
Input, to stdin, is:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	time	cosz
.ft R
.fi

.PP
where time is in decimal days; When cosz is 0.0 (sun below
horizon) the albedo is set to 0.0;
.PP
Output to stdout.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-s\fP \fIstart\fP
\fIstart\fP is time of last snow storm (decimal days)
.sp
.TP
\fB-n\fP \fImax-albeldo\fP
\fImax-albedo\fP is maximum normal albedo when cosz = 1.0
at that time (default: 0.82).
.sp
.TP
\fB-d\fP \fIdecay-range\fP
\fIdecay-range\fP is albedo decay range (default=0.18)
