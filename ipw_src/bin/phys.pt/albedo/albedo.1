.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBalbedo\fP estimates solar albedo over snow for 2 band widths --
visible (280-700nm) and IR (700-2800nm) -- from the time since
the last snow storm, and the solar zenith angle.
.PP
Based on work by \fIWarren & Wiscombe (1980)\fP, \fIWiscombe and Warren
(1980)\fP, and \fIMarshall and Warren (1987)\fP characterizing the
spectral and broad band solar albedo of snow;
\fBalbedo\fP models albedo as a function of grain growth and sun angle;
Estimates decay of albedo with grain growth by approximating a
set theoretical values presented in \fIMarshall and Warren (1987)\fP;
Reasonable grain growth rates and contamination values are
based on two years of albedo data from the Mammoth Mt. experimental
snow study site.
.PP
Grain growth rate approximated by a second order Chebyshev
polynomial (see routine growth()), as this function fit the
Mammoth data; Albedo increases with low solar incidence angles
are approximated with as a function of cos(z) which also fit
the Mammoth data; Both functions give results that approximate
measured values, and agree with results in \fIChoudhury (1981)\fP,
and \fIMcGuffie and Henderson-Sellers (1985)\fP, both of which
present an analysis of the broad band albedo of snow;
.PP
Marshall and Warren show that albedo, when the solar zenith
is 0, is related to the square root of the grain radius by:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	alb(vis0) = 1.0 - sqrt(gsize)/500;
	alb(ir0)  = 0.85447 * exp(-0.02123 * sqrt(gsize));
.ft R
.fi
.PP
This allows a linear alb(vis) decay from about .98 to .90,
and a non-linear alb(ir) decay from .70 to .40, when given
reasonable inputs;
The effect of zenith angle is also related to the sqrt(gsize):
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	dzv       = (sqrt(gsize) * 1.375e-3) * (1 - cos(z))
	alb(visz) = alb(vis0) + dzv
	dzir      = (sqrt(gsize) * 2.0e-3 + 0.1) * (1 - cos(z))
	alb(irz)  = alb(ir0) + dzir
.ft R
.fi
.PP
This allows alb(vis) increases from .014 to .068 with zenith
angle, and alb(ir) increases from .12 to .20 with zenith angle;
.PP
The Mammoth data show new snow "gsize" values tend to be around
100-200 in spring, with larger or smaller values later or
earlier in the season; "maxgsz" tends to be 500-700 mu m in mid
season, with values seldom reaching 1000;
"dirt" is a factor relating the "effective grain size" in the
visible to that in the IR, as the visible is strongly effected
by contamination while the IR is not;
Contamination is site specific but the Mammoth data show
that the "effective grain size" in the visible is usually
between 1.5 and 3.0 times what it is in the IR;
Lower values may be used in early season, and higher in late
season conditions;
.PP
Input, to stdin, is:

where time is in decimal days; When cosz is 0.0 (sun below
horizon) the albedo is set to 0.0;
