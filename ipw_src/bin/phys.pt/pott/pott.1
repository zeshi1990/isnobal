.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBpott\fP is one of a group of commands designed to simulate energy,
climate, or hydrologic processes or properties at a point.
Most were originally written as "qdips" (Quick and Dirty Image
Processing System) programs by D. Marks, during the 1980's at UCSB.
.PP
\fBpott\fP does the following:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
    1) calculates sea-level or potential temperature from air
       temperature at specified elevation,
    2) or inverts sea-level or potential temperature to calculate
       air temperature at a specified elevation.
.ft R
.fi
.PP
(see \fIGeneral Meteorology, Byers, 1974\fP)
.PP
The input is from stdin, output is written to stdout.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-i\fP
invert sea-level or potential temperature to calculate air temp
(default is to calculate sea-level or potential temp from air temp)
.sp
.TP
\fB-l\fP \fIval\fP
lapse rate used in estimation of pressure or linear adjustment
(default: -6.5 C/km)
.sp
.TP
\fB-s\fP \fIval\fP
sea-level temp. used in estimation of pressure (default: 26.84 C)
.sp
.TP
\fB-L\fP
do simple linear adjustment based on lapse rate & elevation
.PP
input conatins values of air temperature (C) and elevation (m) or
.PP
sea-level or potential temperature (C) and elevation (m) if \fB-i is set
.PP
(defaults to stdin)
.SH OPERANDS
.PP
none
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To convert air temperature to potential temperature,
using default lapse rate and sea-level temperatures:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	paste ta elev | \fBpott\fP
.ft R
.fi

.PP
To convert air temperatures from met stations to sea-level temperatures
using a simple linear lapse rate of -5.5C/km:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	paste ta elev | \fBpott\fP -l -5.5 -L
