.SH NAME
.PP
\fBtext2ipw\fP - convert text file with data to IPW image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
\fBtext2ipw\fP \fB-l\fP \fInlines\fP \fB-s\fP \fInsamps\fP [ \fB-b\fP \fInbands\fP ] [ \fB-n\fP \fInbits\fP[,\fI...\fP] ]
      [\fIinfile\fP]
.ft R

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBtext2ipw\fP reads ASCII floating point values from \fIinfile\fP (default:
standard input) and writes an IPW image containing those points to
the standard output.
.PP
The data values are read free-format: any amount of white space
separates each value, any number of values may be on an input line.
The data values are assumed to be in band-interleaved-by-pixel, row
by column order.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-l\fP \fInlines\fP
The output image will have \fInlines\fP lines.
.sp
.TP
\fB-s\fP \fInsamps\fP
The output image will have \fInsamps\fP samples.
.sp
.TP
\fB-l\fP \fInlines\fP
and \fB-s must always be specified.
.sp
.TP
\fB-b\fP \fInbands\fP
The output image will have \fInbands\fP bands (default: 1).  For
each sample in the output image, \fInbands\fP values will be read.
.sp
.TP
\fB-n\fP \fInbits\fP[,\fI...\fP]
The output image will have \fInbits\fP bits for each band
(default: 8).  If more than one value is given, there must
be \fInbands\fP values given.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
If the file "input.dat" contains:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	0       0.5     2.2     1.3     6.5     12.2
	21.5    3.5     -1.5    0.1     13.4    -1.9
.ft R
.fi

.PP
then the following command:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     text2ipw  -l 6  -s 2  input.dat  >image
.ft R
.fi

.PP
creates an image with 6 lines, 2 samples per line where the
first lines contains samples 0 and 0.5, line 2 contains samples
2.2 and 1.3, etc.
.SH FILES
.PP
None.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.TP
input file contains more than %d values - remainder ignored
.br
	More data values were given than could fit in \fInlines\fP by
	\fInsamps\fP by \fInbands\fP.
.sp
.TP
read past EOF, line \fIline\fP
.br
	Not enough data values were given to fill \fInlines\fP by \fInsamps\fP
	by \fInbands\fP.
.sp
.TP
must specify #bits for each band or one value for all
.br
	If the \fB-n option is used, it must have either one argument,
	which specified the bits for all bands, or the same number
	of arguments as bands in the output image as specified by
	the \fB-b option.
.sp
.TP
write error - output file likely incomplete
.br
	It is likely that the program ran out of temporary space.  By
	changing the value of your environment variable "TMPDIR" to
	a directory with more space, it may succeed.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
If a one band image is output, and \fInlines\fP * \fInsamps\fP is less than
1 million, then no temporary file will be used.  This has some
advantages, but the program will use more memory.

New routine ffscanf reads in multiple values in one call
of fscanf for speed improvement.  It also can correctly
deal with fpixel_t not being a float.

Name changed from "import" to "\fBtext2ipw\fP" to avoid
conflict with ImageMagic (Unix) utility of the same name.

Name changed from "iimport" for consistency with other IPW commands.
