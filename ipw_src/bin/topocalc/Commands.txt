Topographic Calculations

  deltaz    - differences from mean-weighted station elevations
  gradient  - slope and aspect from elevation
  ggradient - slope and aspect from elevation (global-scale)
  horizon   - horizon in one direction
  ghorizon  - horizon for one direction (global-scale)
  shade     - cosine of local illumination angle
  gshade    - cosine of illumination angle (global-scale)
  viewf     - sky view and terrain configuration factors
  gviewf    - sky view and terrain configuration factors (global-scale)
  gviewf-mp - multi-processor version of 'gviewf' command
  bmask     - create a basin-delineation mask
  pmask     - create a pit mask
