.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Horizon is part of a suite of radiation, solar, and topographic
geometry tools that are part of the IPW system
.PP
Horizon computes the local \fBhorizon\fP angles toward the direction
azimuth, where azimuth=0 is toward the south and positive
angles are counter-clockwise.
.PP
\fBhorizon\fP reads elevations from \fIimage\fP (default: standard input)
and writes to the standard output an image whose pixels encode
the local \fBhorizon\fP angles in the direction \fIazimuth\fP degrees
(ranging from -180 to 180) from south (positive east).  The
value of each output pixel is the cosine of the angle from the
zenith to the pixel's \fBhorizon\fP in the forward (increasing sample
coordinates) direction.  (Note than this value is also the sine
of the angle from true horizontal to the pixel's \fBhorizon\fP.)
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-a\fP \fIazimuth\fP
The direction of forward azimuth (i.e. increasing samples
along a line) is \fIazimuth\fP degrees east of south (-180..180).
.sp
.TP
\fB-d\fP \fIdelta\fP
grid spacing (default: get grid spacing from the "geo"
header or set to 1 if no "geo" header).  Must be greater
than 0.  The units should be the same as for the elevations.
.TP
\fB-P\fP \fInthreads\fP
number of threads to use, default=1 (parallel processing)
.PP
The following options change the output from linearly quantized
.PP
cosines to a 1-bit mask in which 1's indicate \fBhorizon\fP angles
.PP
greater than a specified threshold.  They are typically used to
.PP
specify a solar zenith angle, the output being a mask of pixels
.PP
where the sun is visible.
.TP
\fB-z\fP \fIzen\fP
mask \fBhorizon\fP angles with greater than \fIzen\fP degrees (0..90).
.sp
.TP
\fB-u\fP \fIcos\fP
mask \fBhorizon\fP angles with cosines greater than \fIcos\fP.
.SH OPERANDS
.TP
[\fIimage\fP]
	elevation image (stdin)
.sp
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To compute northwest horizons:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	horizon -a -135
.ft R
.fi

.PP
To produce a mask of all northwest \fBhorizon\fP angles greater than
45 degrees:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	horizon -a -135 -z 45
.ft R
.fi

.PP
(i.e., any pixels that would be shadowed by adjacent terrain at
this solar zenith and azimuth would be masked as 0.)
.SH FILES
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     $TMPDIR/horizon\fINNNNN\fP
     	temporary command file, removed when horizon exits
.ft R

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.TP
spacing in geodetic header ignored
.br
	The \fB-d option overrides any pixel spacing information
	in the input image.
.sp
.TP
both \fB-u and \fB-z specified, \fB-z over-ridden
.br
	If both \fB-u and \fB-z are specified then \fB-z is ignored.
.sp
.TP
input file has \fInbands\fP bands
.br
	The input image must have only 1 band.
.sp
.TP
only 1 line in input image
only 1 samp in input image
.br
	The input image must have at least 2 lines and 2 samples.
.sp
.TP
input file has no LQH, raw values used
no geodetic header, spacing set to 1.0
.br
	These deficiencies in the input image will introduce
	linear errors into the \fBhorizon\fP calculations.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
\fBhorizon\fP is a shell script than skews and/or transposes the input
image to orient its scan lines in the direction \fIazimuth\fP, then
calls hor1d to perform the actual \fBhorizon\fP calculations.
