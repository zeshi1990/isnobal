## NAME
##	gviewf-mp -- compute view factors from global-scale elevation image
##
## SYNOPSIS
##	gviewf-mp [-x] [-m mask] image
##
## DESCRIPTION
##	Gviewf-mp is a "quasi multi-processor" version of the program gviewf.
##	It was derived by modification of the program gviewf.  It is designed
##	such that it submits up to 4 seperate jobs at a time, waiting until
##	they complete before continuing on.  This has the effect taking
##	advantage of multi-processor machines, when mult-threaded compilers
##	are not available.
##
##	All manual descriptions for gviewf-mp are identical to those for gviewf.
##
##	Gviewf is part of a family of large area, or "global", scale radiation
##	transfer simulation, and solar/terrain geometry calculation tools,
##	developed after the small-scale radiation transfer and terrain structure
##	tools, developed at UCSB by Jeff Dozier, Jim Frew, and Ralph Dubayah.
##
##	All of the global-scale radiation transfer tools are designated by
##	the "g" prefix in front of the small-scale tool's name.  These tools
##	assume that solar geometry, atmospheric properties, and sun rise and sun
##	set vary over the grid, and they also correct for earth curvature when
##	computing horizons, terrain and sky view factors, and illumantion angles.
##
##	These global-scale radiation and terrain processing tools can be applied
##	to areas of size, up to the entire earth.  The global-scale radiation
##	and terrain processing tools were originally developed by Kelly Longley,
##	Oregon State University, at the Corvallis, Oregon, EPA lab, in the early
##	1990's.
##
##	Gviewf is the global-scale version of the program viewf.
##	gviewf reads elevation data from {image} (default: standard input)
##	and writes the corresponding sky view and terrain configuration
##	factors to the standard output.
##
##	gviewf first calculates the gradient using the IPW command ggradient,
##	then a 16-angle (32-angle with the -x option) horizon image using
##	ghorizon.  It then passes these to viewcalc.
##
##	When the input file covers a large area (over one degree -- about
##	100 kilometers -- in either dimension), it is recommended that
##	gviewf be used instead of viewf.
##
## OPTIONS
##	-x	use 32 horizon directions (16 default)
##	-m	mask image
##
## OPERAND
##	image	elevation image (geodetic (lat,long) coordinate system)
##
## EXAMPLES
##	To calculate horizons, in 32 directions, over basin within a large
##	area dem, on a machine with 4 processors:
##
##		gviewf-mp -x -m basin_mask dem_image
##
## FILES
##	$TMPDIR/gviewf.{NNNNN}/*
##
##		Temporary directory containing intermediate gradient
##		and horizon files.
##
## DIAGNOSTICS
##	See ggradient, ghorizon, gviewf, and viewcalc.
##
## RESTRICTIONS
##	gviewf cannot read the elevation image from standard input.
##
##	The input elevation image must use the Geographic (lat/lon)
##	coordinate system.
##
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS
##	See viewf.
##
## HISTORY
##	8/6/90   Written by Kelly Longley, Oregon State University,
##		 Environmental Protection Agency Laboratory, Corvallis OR
##	4/17/91	 Now uses ghorizon instead of shew, transpose and hor1d.
##	8/3/95	 New option to use 32 horizons instead of 16.
##
## BUGS
##	The use of 16 horizon images used to be hard-coded in gviewf.  This
##	was originally done to save cpu time, and because it was thought that
##	would yield sufficient resolution even in very rugged terrain.  In
##	practice, that was not always the case.  The -x option allows 32 horizon
##	directions, and, while this is slower than 16, does it usually is not
##	prohibitively slow.  For DEM resolutions less than 15 arc-sec (500m)
##	the -x (32 horizon directions) is recommended.
