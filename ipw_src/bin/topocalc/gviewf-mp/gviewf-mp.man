<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Gviewf-mp is a &quot;quasi multi-processor&quot; version of the program gviewf.
It was derived by modification of the program gviewf.  It is designed
such that it submits up to 4 seperate jobs at a time, waiting until
they complete before continuing on.  This has the effect taking
advantage of multi-processor machines, when mult-threaded compilers
are not available.
</P><P>
All manual descriptions for <B>%name</B> are identical to those for gviewf.
</P><P>
Gviewf is part of a family of large area, or &quot;global&quot;, scale radiation
transfer simulation, and solar/terrain geometry calculation tools,
developed after the small-scale radiation transfer and terrain structure
tools, developed at UCSB by Jeff Dozier, Jim Frew, and Ralph Dubayah.
</P><P>
All of the global-scale radiation transfer tools are designated by
the &quot;g&quot; prefix in front of the small-scale tool's name.  These tools
assume that solar geometry, atmospheric properties, and sun rise and sun
set vary over the grid, and they also correct for earth curvature when
computing horizons, terrain and sky view factors, and illumantion angles.
</P><P>
These global-scale radiation and terrain processing tools can be applied
to areas of size, up to the entire earth.  The global-scale radiation
and terrain processing tools were originally developed by Kelly Longley,
Oregon State University, at the Corvallis, Oregon, EPA lab, in the early
1990's.
</P><P>
Gviewf is the global-scale version of the program viewf.
gviewf reads elevation data from <I>image</I> (default: standard input)
and writes the corresponding sky view and terrain configuration
factors to the standard output.
</P><P>
gviewf first calculates the gradient using the IPW command ggradient,
then a 16-angle (32-angle with the <B>-x</b> option) horizon image using
ghorizon.  It then passes these to viewcalc.
</P><P>
When the input file covers a large area (over one degree -- about
100 kilometers -- in either dimension), it is recommended that
gviewf be used instead of viewf.

The input elevation image must use the Geographic (lat/lon)
coordinate system.

<H2>BUGS</H2>

<P>
The use of 16 horizon images used to be hard-coded in gviewf.  This
was originally done to save cpu time, and because it was thought that
would yield sufficient resolution even in very rugged terrain.  In
practice, that was not always the case.  The <B>-x</b> option allows 32 horizon
directions, and, while this is slower than 16, does it usually is not
prohibitively slow.  For DEM resolutions less than 15 arc-sec (500m)
the <B>-x</b> (32 horizon directions) is recommended.
