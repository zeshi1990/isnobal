.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Ggradient is part of a family of large area, or "global", scale radiation
transfer simulation, and solar geometry calculation tools, developed
after the small-scale radiation transfer tools, developed at UCSB by
Jeff Dozier and Ralph Dubayah.
.PP
All of the global-scale radiation transfer tools are designated by
the "g" prefix in front of the small-scale tool's name.  These tools
assume that solar geometry, atmospheric properties, and sun rise and sun
set vary over the grid, and they also correct for earth curvature.
The global-scale radiation transfer tools can be applied to areas of
size, up to the entire earth.  The global-scale radiation transfer tools
were originally developed by Kelly Longley, Oregon State University,
at the Corvallis, Oregon, EPA lab, in the early 1990's.
.PP
Ggradient is the global-scale version of the program gradient.
Ggradient reads elevations from \fIimage\fP (default: standard input)
and writes a 2-band image of the slope and aspect (the magnitude
and direction of the gradient) to the standard output.  This program
differs from the gradient program in that the input image must be
be in a latitude/longitude geodetic projection, and the output is
corrected for variation in x- and y-distances over a geodetic grid.
.PP
Ggradient computes the slope and aspect of each pixel in a
global-scale elevation image (with latitude/longitude geodetic
projection).  The 2-band output image has slope	as its first band
and aspect as its second.  Slope is stored as sin(S) with range
from 0 to 1.  Aspect is stored with range from -pi to pi.  Aspect 0
is toward the south, with negative west of south and positive
east of south.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.TP
Input image must have geodetic header, and must be in lat/lon projection
.br
