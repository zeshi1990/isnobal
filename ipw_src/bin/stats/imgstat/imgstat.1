\fBimgstat\fP - statistics for an IPW image
.SH SYNOPSIS

.ft CR
\fBimgstat\fP [ \fB-m\fP \fImask\fP ] [ \fB-c\fP ] [ \fB-h\fP \fIhist_file\fP ] [ \fB-a\fP ]
      [ \fB-u\fP ] [\fIimage\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBimgstat\fP reads an \fIimage\fP and computes the
the minimum, maximum, median, mean, and standard deviation for all
unmasked pixels.  These are then printed to the standard output in
the following format:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     npixels:      {# of pixels}
     min:          {min pixel value}
     max:          {max pixel value}
     median:       {median pixel value}
     mean:         {mean pixel value}
     stdev:        {standard deviation}
.ft R
.fi

.PP
If the \fB-u\fP option is specified, then the following line is also
printed:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     units:        {units from LQ header}
.ft R
.fi

.PP
If the \fB-a (abbreviated output) option is specified, the statistics
are written on one line to the standard output with no titles.  If
the \fB-u\fP option is specified with the \fB-a option, then the units in
quotes is also printed at the end of the output line.
.PP
\fIimage\fP must have exactly one band unless the \fB-c option
is specified, in which case a two band image is expected, the first band
being a class identifier, and the second band being the data.  In addition
to the image statistics, per class information is printed to the
standard output in the following format:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     nclasses:  {#classes}
     class       #pixels    min     max     median     mean     stdev
     {class0}  {#npixels}  {min}   {max}   {median}   {mean}   {stdev}
     ...
     {classN}  {#npixels}  {min}   {max}   {median}   {mean}   {stdev}
.ft R
.fi

.PP
If the \fB-a option is specified, the statistics are written without
column headings.
.PP
If class statistics are being calculated, a histogram file with a
count of the number of pixels in each class / data value combination
can be written to a file by using the \fB-h option.  This histogram
file is a text file formatted like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     {class}   {data_value}   {count}
.ft R
.fi
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-m\fP \fImask\fP
Use \fImask\fP as a mask image.  Any points in \fImask\fP that are 0
will not be used when calculating statistics.
.sp
.TP
\fB-c\fP
A 2 band image is expected, with the first band being a class
identifier image, and the second being the data.  In addition
to the statistics for the entire image, statistics for each
class are also output.
.sp
.TP
\fB-h\fP \fIhist_file\fP
Histogram information for each class / data value combination
will be written to the file \fIhist_file\fP.  One line will be
written for each class / data value combination.  This option
is only valid with the \fB-c option.
.sp
.TP
\fB-a\fP
The statistics will be printed in an abbreviated form with no
header information.
.sp
.TP
\fB-u\fP
Print the units.
.SH OPERANDS
.TP
\fIimage\fP
input image (default: standard input)
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To calculate basic image statistics for the Columbia River basin given
a DEM "northwest" and a basin mask "columbia.mask":
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	imgstat  -m columbia.mask  northwest
.ft R
.fi

.PP
Given a class image "veg" and a soil moisture image "soilm", statistics
can be calculated for soil moisture within each vegetation class with:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	mux veg soilm | imgstat -c
.ft R
.fi
.SH FILES
.PP
None.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP
can't read class-range header
The class identifier image (band 0) does not have a class-range
header.  This header contains the number of classes.  Without
this information, the program will use 2^nbits for the number
of classes, which will usually be too many.  The program \fBmkcrh\fP
can be used to add a class-range header.
.sp
.TP
-h option ignored; -c must also be specified
Since the \fB-h option prints out histogram information by class,
the \fB-c option must be specified to compute the class statistics.
.sp
.TP
-f is now obsolete
The old \fBimgstat\fP used a slow algorithm that had to read the
entire image into memory then sort it to find the median.
Using Sun qsort, this could take hours or days for large
images.  While GNU _quicksort reduced this to minutes, it still
took far too long to be usable.  The new algorithm does not
read the entire image, nor does it sort any data.  Large images
can be processed in seconds, with no penalty for computing the
median.  Therefore this option has been removed.
.sp
.TP
image has \fIbands\fP bands; image must have 2 bands
The \fB-c option was specified, so the input image must have
two bands.  The first band is the class identifier, and the
second band is the data.
.sp
.TP
image has \fIbands\fP bands; single band images only
The \fB-c option was not specified, so the input image must have
only one band.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
None
.SH HISTORY
.TP
Jun 1990
Written by Kelly Longley, Oregon State University,
Environmental Research Laboratory, Corvallis OR.
.sp
.TP
Jul 1990
Added class statistics (\fB-c option) and class histogram;
Added \fB-f\fP option for "fast" computation - no median.
Kelly Longley, Oregon State University.
.sp
.TP
Apr 1991
Modified "fast" version to not read in entire file,
Kelly Longley, Oregon State University.
.sp
.TP
Feb 1993
Modified to use _quicksort instead of qsort for a huge
increase in performance, Dana Jacobsen, ERL-C.
.sp
.TP
Aug 1993
Completely rewrote program, using a histogramming
algorithm.  We do not need to load in the entire image,
so much less memory is taken.  No sorting is done, so it
is much faster and has no penalty for computing the
median.  The class and histogram output is formatted
slightly differently.  Dana Jacobsen, ERL-C.
.sp
.TP
Jul 1995
Check for reversed lq maps.  Dana Jacobsen, ERL-C.

.TP
Nov 1995
Added -u option.  J. Domingo, OSU, EPA NHEERL/WED.
.SH BUGS

Susceptible to rounding error.
