.SH NAME
.PP
\fBmstats\fP - multivariate statistics for an IPW image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
\fBmstats\fP \fB-c\fP \fIclasses\fP \fIimage\fP
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBmstats\fP computes the band-wise mean vector and variance-covariance
matrix for the input \fIimage\fP.  The
statistics are written in text to the standard output, in the
following format:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-c\fP \fIclasses\fP
Read classes from \fIclasses\fP image
This must be a single-band image with the same dimensions
as the input image.  A separate set of statistics is
accumulated and output for each unique pixel value in the
class image.  The pixel at (line,sample) in the input image
is assigned to the class of the pixel in the \fIclasses\fP image.
.SH OPERANDS
.TP
\fIimage\fP
input image
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
If "image" is a multiband satellite image, and "basin" is a
registered mask of a drainage basin, then
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
        mstats -c basin image
.ft R
.fi

.PP
will compute the separate multivariate statistics for areas inside
and outside the basin.
.SH FILES
.PP
None.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP
input and class image must have same # lines
.TP
input and class image must have same # samples
The input and class images must have the same dimensions.
.sp
.TP
class image must have only 1 band
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
\fBmstats\fP will always use any linear quantization ("LQ") headers in
the input image to transform the input values.  If statistics for
the raw pixel values are desired, then any "LQ" headers must be
removed from the input image before is is passed to \fBmstats\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
        rmhdr -d lq | mstats
.ft R
.fi

.PP
Computing variances involves accumulating a sum of squares of all
input values.  the larger the input image, the more likely that
the output variances and covariances will contain rounding errors.
.PP
Means and (co-)variances will be printed with the maximum precision
supported by the hose architecture.  The low-order digits should
probably be ignored.

Oct 1997
Made the \fB-c\fP option required instead of optional.  The program
crashed if this option was not specified.  J. Domingo, OSU
.SH BUGS
.PP
Previously, the program would crash if the \fB-c\fP option was not
specified.
