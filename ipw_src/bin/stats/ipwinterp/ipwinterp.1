\fBipwinterp\fP - interpolate IPW image using parameters from 'istatrel' command

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBipwinterp\fP reads parameters from the standard input (supplied by
the IPW program istatrel) and a single-band IPW image, and
calculates an estimated image which is written to the standard
output.
.PP
The output image is calculated by applying the polynomial
interpolating function received from the standard input to each
point in the independent image specified on the command line.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-v\fP
\fBipwinterp\fP will print extra information on the standard
error.  This includes the number of points read, the
number of points interpolated (points inside the range of
the original data) and the number of point extrapolated
(points outside the range of the original data).  Verbose
output also includes a quick data fit analysis.
.sp
.TP
\fB-a\fP
A quick data fit analysis only is requested.  No output
image is generated, and no input image is required.
.sp
.TP
\fB-b\fP \fIbits\fP
The number of bits in the output image is \fIbits\fP
(default: 8).
.sp
.TP
\fB-m\fP \fImask\fP
Use \fImask\fP as a mask image.  Any points in \fImask\fP that are
0 will have the corresponding points in \fIimage\fP ignored.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Given USA and Canada elevation images, and USA AVHRR channel 5
data, make an estimated channel 5 surface for Canada:

.ft R
.fi

.PP
To give some information on how two NDVI and LAI images are related:
.sp

	istatrel ndvi.ipw lai.ipw | ipwinterp -a

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.TP
Good: Very high linear correlation in original data.
.br
	The coefficient of determination (r^2) of the original
	data is above 0.9.
.sp
.TP
Good: Very low coeff of variation in original data.
.br
	The coefficient of variation (s/Xbar), also known as the
	coefficient of dispersion, of the original data is
	below 0.1.
.sp
.TP
Bad:  Very low coeff of multiple determination.
.br
	The coefficient of multiple determination (r^2) between
	the original image and the interpolated polynomial is
	below 0.5.
.sp
.TP
Bad:  Very high coeff of contingency.
.br
	The coefficient of contingency (a measure of the degree
	of relationship, association, or dependence of the
	classifications) is above 0.9.
.sp
.TP
Ave:  High coeff of contingency.
.br
	The coefficient of contingency is above 0.5.
.sp
.TP
Good: Very low coeff of contingency.
.br
	The coefficient of contingency is below 0.1.
.sp
.TP
Bad:  High error percentage.  Can't establish relation.
.br
	The error percentage ( (the standard error of estimate of
	Y on X) / (the standard deviation) ) is above 0.9.
.sp
.TP
Ave:  Relation has high error percentage.
.br
	The error percentage is above 0.5.
.sp
.TP
Good: Relation is very strong.
.br
	The error percentage is below 0.1.
.sp
.TP
Bad:  High cofv percentage.  Can't establish relation.
.br
	The interpolated to original coefficient of variation
	ratio ( (the coefficient of variation between the
	original image and the interpolated polynomial) / (the
	coefficient of variation of the original data) ) is
	below 0.1.
.sp
.TP
Good: Relation established.
.br
	The interpolated to original coefficient of variation
	ratio is above 0.5.
.sp
.TP
Good: Relation is very strong.
.br
	The interpolated to original coefficient of variation
	ratio is above 0.9.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
If too many points are extrapolated (use the \fB-v option to see this)
rather than interpolated, the results are likely to not be accurate.
.PP
The quick data fit analysis has been put together by empirical
evidence.  It is not too hard to get a data set that gives
contradictory remarks.  If it gives more than one bad remark, it
would be best to view the data and relationships established using
istatgraph.
