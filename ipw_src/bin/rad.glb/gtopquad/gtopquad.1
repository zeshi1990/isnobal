.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Gtopquad is part of a family of large area, or "global", scale radiation
transfer simulation, and solar/terrain geometry calculation tools,
developed after the small-scale radiation transfer and terrain structure
tools, developed at UCSB by Jeff Dozier, Jim Frew, and Ralph Dubayah.
.PP
All of the global-scale radiation transfer tools are designated by
the "g" prefix in front of the small-scale tool's name.  These tools
assume that solar geometry, atmospheric properties, and sun rise and sun
set vary over the grid, and they also correct for earth curvature when
computing horizons, terrain and sky view factors, and illumantion angles.
.PP
These global-scale radiation and terrain processing tools can be applied
to areas of size, up to the entire earth.  The global-scale radiation
and terrain processing tools were originally developed by Kelly Longley,
Oregon State University, at the Corvallis, Oregon, EPA lab, in the early
1990's.
.PP
Gtopquad is the global-scale version of the program topquad.
Gtopquad computes daily integrated radiation over a global-scale
topographic grid, using a two-stream atmospheric radiation model and
21-point Kronrod quadrature between sunrise and sunset for each pixel.
It is implemented as a shell script which makes repeated calls to
gshade, gelevrad, gsunlight, gviewf, ghorizon, and gtoporad.
.PP
The input image file has eight bands in the following order:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	elevation			(dem data)
	slope				(from ggradient)
	azimuth				(from ggradient)
	sky view factor			(from gviewf)
	terrain configuration factor	(from gviewf)
	surface albedo			(estimate or data)
	reflectance of substrate	(estimate or data)
	optical depth			(estimate or data)
