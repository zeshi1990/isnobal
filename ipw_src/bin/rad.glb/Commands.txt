Radiation Modeling: Global-Scale

  gelevrad    - beam and diffuse irradiance from elevation
  gsunlight   - sun angles: azimuth and zenith angles of sun's position
  gsunweights - Kronrod quadrature weights and sun angles
  gtoporad    - topographically-corrected solar radiation
  gtoporad.24 - topographically-corrected solar radiation for 24-hour period
  gtopquad    - daily integrated radiation over a topographic grid
