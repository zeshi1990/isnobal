.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBgsunlight\fP is part of a family of large area, or "global",
scale radiation transfer simulation, and solar/terrain geometry calculation
tools, developed after the small-scale radiation transfer and terrain structure
tools, developed at UCSB by Jeff Dozier, Jim Frew, and Ralph Dubayah.
.PP
All of the global-scale radiation transfer tools are designated by
the "g" prefix in front of the small-scale tool's name.  These tools
assume that solar geometry, atmospheric properties, and sun rise and sun
set vary over the grid, and they also correct for earth curvature when
computing horizons, terrain and sky view factors, and illumantion angles.
.PP
These global-scale radiation and terrain processing tools can be applied
to areas of size, up to the entire earth.  The global-scale radiation
and terrain processing tools were originally developed by Kelly Longley,
Oregon State University, at the Corvallis, Oregon, EPA lab, in the early
1990's.
.PP
Gsunlight is the global-scale version of the program sunlight.
Gsunlight calculates sun angles (solar azimuth and zenith) for a global
scale area defined by the given geodetic header for the given date
time.  Gsunlight writes an output image to stdout with two bands:
mu (cos solar zenith angle), followed by the solar azimuth (degrees
0 - 360 East from S. Pole).
