.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Gtoporad.24 is part of a family of large area, or "global", scale
radiation transfer simulation, and solar/terrain geometry calculation
tools, designed from the small-scale radiation transfer and terrain
structure tools, developed at UCSB by Jeff Dozier, Jim Frew, and
Ralph Dubayah.
.PP
All of the global-scale radiation transfer and terrain processing tools
are designated by the "g" prefix in front of the small-scale tool's name.
These tools assume that solar geometry, atmospheric properties, and sun
rise and sun set vary over the grid.  They also correct for earth
curvature when computing horizons, terrain and sky view factors,
and illumantion angles.
.PP
These global-scale radiation and terrain processing tools can be applied
to areas of any size, up to the entire earth.  They were originally
developed by Kelly Longley, Oregon State University, at the Corvallis,
Oregon, EPA lab, in the early 1990's.
.PP
Gtoporad.24 is the global-scale version of the program toporad.24.
Gtoporad.24 is a shell script that sets up and calls gsunlight, gelevrad,
ghorizon, gshade, and gtoporad n times over a 24hour period, to
compute global-scale solar radiation over a topographic grid for a
full day, using a two-stream atmospheric radiation model.  The radiation
is computed and output every delta_t hours for a total of 24 hours.
The input image file has the following eight bands:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	elevation			(dem)
	slope				(from ggradient)
	azimuth				(from ggradient)
	sky view factor			(from gviewf)
	terrain configuration factor	(from gviewf)
	surface albedo			(from data, or salbedo)
	reflectance of substrate	(estimate or data)
	optical depth			(estimate or data)
.ft R
.fi

.PP
Band 0, 5, and 6 are estimated or from data, as in gtoporad, bands 1-4
are from other ipw programs, and band 7 is a spatially distributed
optical depth, as described in gelevrad.
.PP
The output images are called <out_prefix>.0 ...	<out_prefix>.n
(where n is 24/delta_t).
