.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBmksath\fP constructs an IPW satellite header (SATH) and inserts in into
the headers of \fIimage\fP (default: standard input).  If the specified
bands already have SAT headers, they are overridden, and a warning
message is generated.
.PP
If the \fB-f option is specified, then only the headers are written to
the standard output, and any input image data is ignored.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-s\fP \fIsensor\fP
The image data were acquired by \fIsensor\fP (e.g., "TM", "SPOT",
"AVIRIS", etc.).
.sp
.TP
\fB-p\fP \fIplatform\fP
The \fIsensor\fP was mounted on \fIplatform\fP (e.g., "Landsat-5",
"ER-2", "C-130", etc.).
.sp
.TP
\fB-l\fP \fIlocation\fP
The image data were acquired at or over \fIlocation\fP.  This
should not be a geodetic specification (use mkgeoh for that),
but a sensor-, platform-, or project-specific identifier
(e.g., experimental site name, Landsat path/row, etc.).
.sp
.TP
\fB-d\fP \fIdate\fP
The image data were acquired on \fIdate\fP.  The standard
format for this is \fIYYYYMMDD\fP.
.sp
.TP
\fB-t\fP \fItime\fP
The image data were acquired at \fItime\fP.  The standard
format for this is \fIhhmmss.sss...\fP.
.PP
At least one of \fB-s, \fB-p, \fB-l, \fB-d, and/or \fB-t must be specified.
.TP
\fB-b\fP \fIband\fP[,\fI...\fP]
The "sat" header will be applied only to the specified
\fIband\fPs (default: all bands).
.sp
.TP
\fB-f\fP
Force header output only.  Do not attempt to copy pixel
data from \fIimage\fP to the standard output.  Note that there
must still be at least an input BIH, and any input headers
(except superseded "sat" headers) will still be copied to
the standard output.
.SH OPERANDS
.TP
\fIimage\fP
satellite image (default: standard input)
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To add a satellite header to a landsat TM image over the BOREAS site
on February 15, 1997, at 9:42 in the morning:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	mksath -s TM -p "Landsat-7" -l BOREAS -d 19970215 -t 094200
.ft R
.fi

.PP
(the quotes around "Landsat-7" are necessary to avoid confusion with the
shell.)
.SH FILES
.PP
None.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.TP
bad band number: \fIband\fP
A nonexistent input band was specified with \fB-b.
.sp
.TP
band \fIband\fP: replacing previous SAT header
Band \fIband\fP already had a "sat" headers, which was replaced
by the newly-created one.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
There are not yet any standard identifiers for \fIsensor\fP, \fIplatform\fP,
or \fIlocation\fP.  The \fIdate\fP and \fItime\fP arguments are
recommended but not enforced
