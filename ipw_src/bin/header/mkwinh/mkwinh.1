\fBmkwinh\fP - add a window (WIN) header to an image

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBmkwinh\fP constructs an IPW window header (WINH) and inserts it into
the headers of \fIimage\fP (default: standard input).  If the specified
bands already have WIN headers, they are overridden, and a warning
message is generated.
.PP
If the \fB-f option is specified, then only the headers are written to
the standard output, and any input image data is ignored.
.PP
The "win" header will always be applied to all bands of the image.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-b\fP \fIline\fP,\fIsample\fP
\fIline\fP,\fIsample\fP are the window coordinates of line 0 and
sample 0 in the input image (default: 0,0).
.sp
.TP
\fB-d\fP \fIdline\fP,\fIdsamp\fP
\fIdline\fP,\fIdsamp\fP are the window line and sample spacings in
the input image (default: 1,1).
.sp
.TP
\fB-f\fP
Force header output only.  Do not attempt to copy pixel
data from \fIimage\fP to the standard output.  Note that there
must still be at least an input BIH, and any input headers
(except superseded "win" headers) will still be copied to
the standard output.
.SH OPERANDS
.TP
\fIimage\fP
input image (default: standard input)
