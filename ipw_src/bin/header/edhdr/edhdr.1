.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
\fBedhdr\fP \fIimage ...\fP
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBedhdr\fP allows interactive editing of IPW image headers.  The header is

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
None.
.SH OPERANDS
.TP
\fIimage ...\fP
list of images whose headers are to be edited.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To use \fBedhdr\fP (instead of scale) to stretch a 12-bit dem image so that the
shaded relief image will show inhanced topographic structure:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
        edhdr dem

           \fIChange this line in the header:\fP

                   map = 4095 4095

           \fIto this:\fP

                   map = 4095 40950

        gradient dem | shade -z 45 -a -135

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP
standard input and output must be a terminal

The input image is also the output image, so it must be writable.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
