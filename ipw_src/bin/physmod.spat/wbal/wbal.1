.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Simple water balance model:
.PP
Calculates runoff, soil storage, and actual
evapotranspiration, given precipitation, PET (potential
evapotranspiration), initial soil storage, maximum soil
storage capacity, and a runoff base flow threshold.
Usually run at a mounthly time-step, to match model
asumptions with results.
A weekly or daily time-step could be used, but some of the
because no time lag is coded into the model, it may deplete
soil moisture to quickly.
.br
Model based on the following algorithm:
.PP
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	AvW	= max (Stor + P, 0)
	Sat	= AvW / Smax
	ET	= aet (PET, Sat)
   if (AvW + ET < 0)	{note that ET is negative if
			flux is away from the surface}
	ET	= -AvW
	AvW	+= ET
	Sat	= AvW / Smax
	BF	= baseflow(Bthresh, Sat)
	BF	= min (AvW, min (BF, Smax))
	Ovf	= max (Avw - BF - Smax, 0)
	RO	= Ovf + BF
	Sat	= AvW / Smax
	Stor	= max (AvW - RO, 0)

where:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	AvW	= available water
	Stor	= soil water storage
	P	= total precipitation
	Sat	= % soil saturation
	Smax	= max soil water storage
	ET	= actual evapotranspiration
	PET	= potential evapotranspiration
	BF	= runoff base flow
	Bthresh	= threshold runoff base flow
	Ovf	= storage overflow
	RO	= runoff

.PP
All water units are (mm H2O)/(unit area).
A three-band output image containing runoff, storage, and et
is written to stdout.
