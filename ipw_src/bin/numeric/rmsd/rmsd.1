\fBrmsd\fP - computes model fitting statistics  RMSD, ME, and MBD
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBrmsd\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBrmsd\fP reads an X-Y vector pair (X = "measured".
Y = "modeled") from the standard input and computes
root mean square difference (RMSD), model efficiency (ME),
and mean bias difference (MBD). (Note that RMSD and MBD are
considered "difference" rather than "error" statistics because
there is generally a significant uncertainty in the measured
parameter which makes it difficult to assume that difference
between the "modeled" and "measured" value is an error.)
A small RMSD and MBD shows a good "fit" between the vectors,
as does a ME value approaching 1.0.
