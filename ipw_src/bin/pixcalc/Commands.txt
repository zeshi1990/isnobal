Pixel Calculations

  imath     - calculate an arithmetic expression over each sample's pixels
  imgsum    - sum all pixels in an image
  normalize - normalize image bands
  iinterp   - linearly interpolate single-band image using set of data pairs
  ninterp   - linearly interpolate multi-band image over n-dimensional table
  despike   - remove abnormally large pixel values (spikes)
  bitcom    - bitwise combination of pixels (AND, OR, exclusive-OR)
  iadd      - perform addition or subtraction on pixels (DEPRECIATED)
  mult      - perform multiplication or division on pixels (DEPRECIATED)
  scale     - multiply all pixels by a scaling factor (DEPRECIATED)
  lincom    - linear combination of pixels (DEPRECIATED)
  itrim     - trim image values based on min/max threshold (DEPRECIATED)
