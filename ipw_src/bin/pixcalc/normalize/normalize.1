.SH NAME
.PP
\fBnormalize\fP - normalize image bands
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
\fBnormalize\fP [ \fB-b\fP \fIbits\fP ] [ \fIimage\fP ]
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBnormalize\fP reads a multi-band image and
outputs a multi-band image in which the sum of all bands is a surface
with value 1.0 everywhere (within the available image precision).
.PP
When all bands of an input pixel are 0.0, the program will
output zeros (i.e. these output pixels will not sum to 1.0).
.PP
NOTE:  This program is very sensitive to quantization error.  The
larger the number of image bits used, the closer the sum of the
output bands gets to 1.0.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-b\fP \fIbits\fP
Use \fIbits\fP bits per output pixel (default: 16).
.SH OPERANDS
.TP
\fIimage\fP
multi-band input image (default: standard input)
