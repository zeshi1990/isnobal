.SH NAME
.PP
\fBimgsum\fP - sum all pixels in an image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
\fBimgsum\fP [ \fB-m\fP \fImask\fP ] [ \fIimage\fP ]
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBimgsum\fP reads a single band image and
writes the sum of all unmasked pixels to the standard output.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-m\fP \fImask\fP
Use \fImask\fP as a mask image.  Any points in \fImask\fP that
are 0 will not contribute to the sum.
.SH OPERANDS
.TP
\fIimage\fP
input image (default: standard input)
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
If the file "precip" contains yearly precipitation volume for an
area, and "basin" is a mask of a watershed, then the following
command will give the total precipitation influx into the basin:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
        imgsum -m basin  precip
.ft R
.fi

.PP
Note that this works only for volume data.  If your data is a
depth, then you must first multiply each point by the area of
the pixel.  This only works for Equal-Area projections however.
.SH FILES
.PP
None.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP
image has \fIbands\fP bands; single band images only
Only single band images are supported.  To sum multiple
