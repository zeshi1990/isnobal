.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBiwbt\fP is one of a group of commands designed to simulate energy,
climate, or hydrologic processes or properties at a point.
Most were originally written as "qdips" (Quick and Dirty Image
Processing System) programs by D. Marks, during the 1980's at UCSB.
.PP
\fBiwbt\fP computes wet or ice bulb temperature from input values of
elevation (m), air and dewpoint temperature (C), using Richard Essery's
equations.  It returns wet or ice bulb temperture (C);
Works at all temperatures (accounting for both fusion and vaporization).
<\\P>
.PP
Routine \fBwetbulb\fP is called to compute wet or ice bulb temperature from
values of air and dewpoint temperatures (K), and air pressure (Pa)
derived from elevation using the hydrostatic equation,
using Richard Essery's equations for the psychrometric constant,
its value at specific temperatures from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation,
and solves for the Tw or Ti using the Newton-Raphson iterative approximation.
It returns wet or ice bulb temperture (K);
Works at all temperatures (accounting for both fusion and vaporization).
.PP
\fBiwbt\fP reads a 3-band image of elevation, air and dewpoint temperature
from standard input; Elevation, z, is used to calcualte air pressure;
Output is to standard output;

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-z\fP \fIelev \fP
Use \fIelev\fP to calculate air pressure (default: sea level).
.sp
.TP
\fB-p\fP \fIpressure \fP
\fIpressure\fP is the total air pressure (default: sea level
standard of 101324.6 Pa).
.sp
.TP
\fB-d\fP
Dew point temperatures are also outputed in degrees C.
