.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBialbedo\fP is one of a group of commands designed to simulate energy,
climate, or hydrologic processes or properties over an area.
Most were originally written as "qdips" (Quick and Dirty Image
Processing System) programs to simulate the process at a point
by D. Marks, during the 1980's at UCSB.
\fBialbedo\fP is the spatial version of \fBalbedo\fP.
.PP
\fBialbedo\fP is designed
to estimate albedo of snow in either the visible (280-700nm), or solar
IR (700-2800nm) spectral bands, over an image of cosine solar zenith.
It is based on work by \fIWarren and Wiscombe (1980), Wiscombe and Warren (1980),
Marshall and Warren (1986), Marks (1988), and Marks and Dozier (1992)\fP.
.PP
Snow albedo is modeled as a function of grain growth, and sun angle;
Albedo decay is estimated as a function of grain growth by approximating a
set of theoretical values presented in \fIMarshall and Warren (1986)\fP.
Reasonable grain growth rates and contamination values are
based on two years of snow albedo measurements from the Mammoth Mt. snow
study plot in the eastern Sierra Nevada, California.
.PP
Grain growth rate approximated by a second order Chebyshev
polynomial (see routine \fBgrowth()\fP), as this function fit the
Mammoth data.  Albedo increase with low solar incidence angles
are approximated with as a function of cos(z); which also fit
the Mammoth data.  Both functions give results that approximate
measured values, and agree with results in \fIChoudhury (1981)\fP,
and \fIMcGuffie and Henderson-Sellers (1985)\fP, both of which
present an analysis of the broad band albedo of snow.
.PP
\fIMarshall and Warren (1986)\fP show that albedo, when the solar zenith
is 0, is related to the square root of the grain radius by:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	alb(vis0) = 1.0 - sqrt(gsize)/500;
	alb(ir0)  = 0.85447 * exp(-0.02123 * sqrt(gsize));
.ft R
.fi
.PP
This allows a linear alb(vis) decay from about .98 to .90,
and a non-linear alb(ir) decay from .70 to .40, when given
reasonable inputs;
The effect of zenith angle is also related to the sqrt(gsize):
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	dzv = (sqrt(gsize) * 1.375e-3) * (1 - cos(z));
	alb(visz) = alb(vis0) + dzv;
	dzir = (sqrt(gsize) * 2.0e-3 + 0.1) * (1 - cos(z));
	alb(irz) = alb(ir0) + dzir;
.ft R
.fi
.PP
This allows alb(vis) increases from .014 to .068 with zenith
angle, and alb(ir) increases from .12 to .20 with zenith angle;
.PP
The Mammoth data show new snow "gsize" values tend to be around
100-200 in spring, with larger or smaller values later or
earlier in the season; "maxgsz" tends to be 500-700 mu m in mid
season, with values seldom reaching 1000;
"dirt" is a factor relating the "effective grain size" in the
visible to that in the IR, as the visible is strongly effected
by contamination while the IR is not;
Contamination is site specific but the Mammoth data show
that the "effective grain size" in the visible is usually
between 1.5 and 3.0 times what it is in the IR;
Lower values may be used in early season, and higher in late
season conditions;
.PP
Input image contains cosine local illumination angle.
.PP
Output image is written to stdout contains two bands:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	alb(vis) and alb(ir) at each pixel location.
.ft R
.fi
.PP
If the \fB-v (vis only) or \fB-r (ir only) flag is specified then the
output image will contain only the specified band.
If cosz <= 0.0 (sun below horizon), resulting output albedo is set to
the minimum value (as if cosz = 1.0 - sun directly overhead).

.SH HISTORY
.TP
Oct 1990
Adapded from D. Marks point model (QDIPS program \fBalbedo\fP),
to run over an IPW image, by Kelly Longley, Oregon State
University, Environmental Research Laboratory, Corvallis
.TP
Dec 1990
Changed output albedo(cosz=0) to minimum (as if cosz=1.0)
Kelly Longley, OSU, ERL-C
.TP
Jun 2015
Added a distributed storm image to calculate the albedo
at each pixel which can take into account if the storm didn't precip
over the entire basin.
