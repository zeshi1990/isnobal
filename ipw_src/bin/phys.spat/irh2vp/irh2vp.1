.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBirh2vp\fP is one of a group of commands designed to simulate energy,
climate, or hydrologic processes or properties over an area.
Most were originally written as "qdips" (Quick and Dirty Image
Processing System) programs to simulate the process at a point
by D. Marks, during the 1980's at UCSB.
\fBirh2vp\fP is the spatial version of \fBrh2vp\fP.
.PP
\fBirh2vp\fP reads a two-band \fIimage\fP (default: standard input)
containing relative humidity (RH) and air temperature (Ta),
or vapor pressure (vp) and Ta,
and writes image of the corresponding vp or RH to the standard output.
.PP
(see \fIGeneral Meterology, Byers, 1974\fP)
.PP
If \fB-i is specified, then the operation is reversed:  the input image
contains vp and Ta, and the output image will be the corresponding RH.
.PP
If \fB-c is specified, then the conversion to RH is clipped so that no
values are less than 0.0 or exceed 1.0, or vp is clipped so that no
values are less than 0.0 or exceed sat_vp.  It is recommended that input
bands be checked using "imgstat" to verify that image min/max is
appropriate for either RH or vp. Then the \fB-c option can be used to
clean up noise in the data.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-i\fP
Perform the inverse operation of vapor pressure to relative
humidity.
.sp
.TP
\fB-c\fP
clip RH values to between 0.0 and 1.0, or vp values to
between 0.0 and sat_vp.
.sp
.TP
\fB-b\fP \fInbits\fP
Use \fInbits\fP per output pixel (default: 16).
.sp
.TP
\fB-m\fP \fImask\fP
Use \fImask\fP as a mask image.  Any points in \fImask\fP that are 0
will have the corresponding output pixel set to 0.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Given relative humidity and air temperature images:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	mux humidity temp | irh2vp
.ft R
.fi

.PP
generates vapor pressure.  Likewise:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	mux vappres temp | irh2vp -i
.ft R
.fi

.PP
generates relative humidity.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.TP
image has \fIbands\fP bands; 2 band images only
.br
	The input image must have exactly two bands.
.sp
.TP
input file has no LQH; raw values used
.br
	No LQ header was found in the input image.  This is likely
	to result in incorrect output.
.sp
.TP
Bad input RH, Bad input vp
.br
	if \fB-c (clip) not set, program will terminate on bad input
	RH (values < 0.0 or > 1.0) or vp (values < 0.0 or > sat_vp).
	Even very small errors will cause the program to terminate.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
None
.SH HISTORY
.TP
Jul 1990
	Written by Kelly Longley, Oregon State University,
Environmental Research Laboratory, Corvallis OR
.TP
Oct 1990
	Added \fB-b #output bits option; now scales LQH based on
data min and max.  K. Longley, OSU, EPA ERL-C
.TP
Mar 1997
	Converted to "\fBirh2vp\fP" from "rh2vp" to conform to
conventions of satvp -- isatvp, dewpt -- idewpt.  Old
program "hythrm" also modified, and renamed "rh2vp".
Added \fB-c option to prevent negative values or RH > 1.0,
or vp > sat_vp; D. Marks, USGS, NHEERL, Corvallis, OR.
