.SH NAME

\fBisatvp\fP - saturation vapor pressure from dew point temperature

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBisatvp\fP is one of a group of commands designed to simulate energy,
climate, or hydrologic processes or properties over an area.
Most were originally written as "qdips" (Quick and Dirty Image
Processing System) programs to simulate the process at a point
by D. Marks, during the 1980's at UCSB.  \fBisatvp\fP is the spatial version
of \fBsatvp\fP.
.PP
\fBisatvp\fP reads a single band \fIimage\fP (default: standard input)
containing dew point temperature (in degrees C) and writes the
corresponding saturation vapor pressure image (in Pascals) to the
standard output.
.PP
(see \fIGeneral Meterology, Byers, 1974\fP)
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-m\fP \fImask\fP
Use \fImask\fP as a mask image.  Any points in \fImask\fP that
are 0 will have the corresponding output pixels set to 0.

.br
	Only single band images are accepted.

unrealistic dew point temperature: \fItemp\fP
.br
	A dew point temperature was given that was below 0 degrees
	Celcius.  It is possible that a program like despike could
	correct these values.
