.SH NAME
.PP
\fBpix2fp\fP - map pixel values to floating-point values using image's LQ header
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
\fBpix2fp\fP [ \fB-i\fP \fIimage\fP ] [ \fB-v\fP \fIvalue_file\fP ]
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBpix2fp\fP reads a file \fIvalue_file\fP (default: standard input) containing
raw (unmapped) pixel values, and a single band IPW \fIimage\fP (default:
standard input) that contains an LQ header, and writes floating point
values (the raw values mapped through the LQ header) to the standard
output.
.PP
The input values are integers, not bytes (it is a file of ASCII
text, not a raw image), and the output is a table with two
columns containing the pixel value and the mapped value.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-i\fP \fIimage\fP
Use \fIimage\fP (default: standard input) as the input image to
obtain the LQ header.
.sp
.TP
\fB-v\fP \fIvalue_file\fP
Use \fIvalue_file\fP (default: standard input) as the file
containing raw values.
.PP
At least one of \fB-i and/or \fB-v must be specified.
.SH OPERANDS
.PP
	None
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Given a file containing raw elevation data (straight from the
sensor, not in meters), and an image with has an LQ header that
correctly maps this raw data into floating point (meters perhaps):
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	pix2fp  -i elevmap  -v raw.001
.ft R
.fi

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.TP
At least one of \fB-i,\fB-v must be specified
.br
	\fBpix2fp\fP needs two data files, at least one of which must
	be specified on the command line.
.sp
.TP
image file \fIimage\fP has no LQH
.br
	The mapping from pixel value to floating point is done
	using the LQ header from \fIimage\fP.  This file must have
	an LQ header, or there is no way to map the values.
.sp
.TP
image file \fIimage\fP has more than one band
.br
	Only single band images are accepted.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
Only single band images are supported.
