cvtime:  when using a defined input format, you must
include the  year.  cvtime cannot determine the year
from the "-y" field, rather than unputting it as part
of the input stream;

always returns the current year in the test for leap year...
not able to interpret the year from the "-y" field.

Works when using the pre-defined input formats (jd, jd1,
wy, wy1)

Temp soln: always input the year with the input stream, 
avoiding the use of -y
