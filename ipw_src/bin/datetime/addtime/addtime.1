\fBaddtime\fP - add time to a given date and time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp

.ft CR
\fBaddtime\fP [ \fB-d\fP \fIyear,month,day,hour,min,sec\fP ] [ \fB-h\fP \fIhours\fP ]
     [ \fB-m\fP \fIminutes\fP ] [ \fB-s\fP \fIseconds\fP ] [ \fB-v\fP ]  [ \fIdate-time\fP ]
.ft R

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBaddtime\fP adds a time interval to a specified date-time.  The date-time is
specified either with the \fB-d\fP option or as a single operand.  The time
interval is specified as a combination of hours, minutes, and seconds using
the \fB-h\fP, \fB-m\fP, and \fB-s\fP options, respectively.  The interval
may be negative, to effect subtraction as well.
.PP
The resulting date-time is printed to standard output in the same format
as the input date-time.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-d\fP \fIyear,month,day,hour,min,sec\fP
The date-time to add the time interval to.  All the arguments, i.e.,
\fIyear\fP through \fIsec\fP, are integer values.  If the date-time is
not specified with this option, it must be specified as an operand.
.sp
.TP
\fB-h\fP \fIhours\fP
The number of hours in the time interval to add to the date-time.  \fIhours\fP
may be negative, and may be a decimal number to indicate a portion of
an hour, for example, 1.5 for one and a half hours. (default: 0)
.sp
.TP
\fB-m\fP \fIminutes\fP
The number of minutes in the time interval to add to the date-time.
\fIminutes\fP may be negative, and may be a decimal number to indicate a
portion of an minute, for example, 2.5 for two minutes and 30 seconds.
(default: 0)
.sp
.TP
\fB-s\fP \fIseconds\fP
The number of seconds in the time interval to add to the date-time.
\fIseconds\fP may be negative; however, unlike the hours and minutes, it
must be an integer. (default: 0)
.PP
At least one of the \fB-h\fP, \fB-m\fP and \fB-s\fP options must be
specified.  If two or more of these options are given, then the time
interval consists of their sum.
.TP
\fB-v\fP
Verbose mode.  This option causes the given date-time, the time interval,
and the resulting date-time to be printed in an English format on
standard error.  For example,
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
    Thu Oct  1 12:00:00 1998
     + 3.000000 hours    ===> Thu Oct  1 15:00:00 1998
.ft R
.fi
.SH OPERANDS
.TP
\fIdate-time\fP
The date-time to add the time interval to.  The format of \fIdate-time\fP
is the same as the default format for
\fBcvtime\fP: "%Y_%m_%d+%H:%M:%S",
e.g., "1963_12_04+12:34:56".  If the date-time is not specified as an
operand, then it must be specified with the \fB-d\fP option.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To add 4.6 hours to June 22nd, 1990, 9:00 am:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     addtime -d 1990,6,22,9,0,0 -h 4.6
.ft R
.fi

.PP
The following example has a fragment of a sh shell script that produces a
series of 100 date-times starting at midnight on October 1, 1997 with an
interval of an hour and half:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
    interval="-h 1.5"
    dt="1997_10_01+00:00:00"
    i=1
    while [ $i -le 100 ] ; do
        printf "$dt\\n"
        dt=`addtime $interval $dt`
        i=`expr $i + 1`
    done
.ft R
.fi

.PP
In the example above, the interval could have been also specified in
one of these alternative ways:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
    interval="-h 1 -m 30"
    interval="-m 90"
.ft R

Changed to use mktime instead of timegm and not do
arithmetic on time_t's.  Dana Jacobsen, ERL-C.

Aug 1993
Changed to split time in two parts to avoid integer
overflow and round answer.  Dana Jacobsen, ERL-C.

Converted to Version 2.0; eliminated the \fB-c\fP option
(output UNIX clock time (seconds since 1/1/1970)).

Nov 1998
Allow the date-time to specified as an operand using the
same format as \fBcvtime\fP's operand.  Also added the
\fB-m\fP and \fB-s\fP options.  J. Domingo, OSU
