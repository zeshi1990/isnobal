.SH NAME
.PP
\fBth_adj\fP - thermal radiation adjustment for veg, clouds or both
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
\fBth_adj\fP [image\fP]
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBth_adj\fP adjusts thermal irradiance for cloud and vegetation effects
at a single time, using input clear-sky thermal radiation, supplied by
\fBlocally modified topotherm\fP,
air temperature, and the sky-view factor for cloudcover, supplied by
\fBlocally developed cf_cloud\fP,
or the sky-view factor for vegetation, or a combined cloudcover and
vegetation sky-view.
.PP
The input image has the following bands:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
    band 0 : clear-sky thermal irradiance (Wm^2)
     "   1 : air temperature (C)
     "   2 : sky-view factor (0-1)
.ft R
.fi

.PP
The first band is output from
\fBlocally modified topotherm\fP,
the second band can be generated from data using standard ipw tools
such as
\fBimath\fP
or \fBiinterp\fP,
and the third is output from
\fBlocally modified stoporad\fP
or from data.
.PP
Air temperature (band 1) is used to calculate thermal irrdiance with an
emissivity of 1.0 after converting air temperature to K:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
    BB_thermal = 5.6697e-8 * ta^4
.ft R
.fi

.PP
Adjusted thermal irradiance is then:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
    adj_thermal = (thermal_clear-sky * sky_view_fac) + (BB_thermal * (1 - sky_view_fac))
.ft R
.fi

.PP
The output image has the one band:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
    band 0 : adj_thermal
.ft R
.fi

.PP
Output is to the stdout.
