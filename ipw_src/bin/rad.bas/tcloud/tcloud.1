\fBtcloud\fP - cloudiness attenuation of solar radiation
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
.ft CR
\fBtcloud\fP [\fIimage\fP]
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBtcloud\fP reads a 2 band \fIimage\fP (default: standard input) containing
the daily diurnal temperature range (from deltaT) and writes the
cloudiness attenuation of solar radiation to the standard output
as an 8-bit IPW image.
.PP
The input image contains the two bands: band 0 contains the output
of the program deltaT, and band 1 contains the mean of the monthly
runs of deltaT.
.PP
The output image is calculated as Bristow and Campbell (1984):
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	cloud_coef = 1 - exp(-B deltaT ^ C)
.ft R
.fi

.PP
where:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	B = 0.036 exp (-0.154 mean_deltaT)
	C = 2.4 (constant)
