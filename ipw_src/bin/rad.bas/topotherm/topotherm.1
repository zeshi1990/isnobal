.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBtopotherm\fP calculates thermal radiation from the atmosphere corrected
for topographic effects, from near surface air temperature Ta,
dew point temperature DPT, and elevation.
Based on a model by Marks and Dozier (1979).
.PP
Contribution to emissivity from vegetation canopy and clouds is assumed to
be proportional to attenuation of clear sky view (between 0-1) by each.
Canopy shading is estimated using Beers' Law (Monteith and
Unsworth, 1990), after Wigmosta, Vail, and Lettenmaier (1994).
The input image are canopy or cloud attenuation (from cf_cloud for cloud
attenmation, and from classified vegetation images (veg type, height, and
density) using the imath function for vegetation) such that canopy or cloud
view factors are (1 - canopy_or_cloud_attenuation).
Atmospheric emissivity is enhanced by:

.ft CR
	emiss = emiss * (1 - vegfac) + vegfac
.ft R

.PP
and by cloud cover:

.nf
.ft CR
	emiss = emiss * (1 - cloudfac) + cloudfac
.ft R

.PP
(See Link and Marks 1999a & 1999b;
Marks et al., 1998, 1999b)
.PP
The four-band input image; Band 0 is Ta, band 1 is DPT, band 2 is elev,
and band 3 is skyview factor (from viewf or gviewf).
Output is a 1-byte image of thermal irradiance from the atmosphere.
.PP
Vegetation and cloud view factors are computed as 1-attenuation from
the input images.
