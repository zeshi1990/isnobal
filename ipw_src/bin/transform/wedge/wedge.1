.SH NAME
.PP
\fBwedge\fP - linear combination of line and sample coordinates
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
\fBwedge\fP \fB-c\fP \fIlcoef\fP,\fIscoef\fP[,\fI...\fP] [ \fB-n\fP \fInbits\fP ] [\fIimage\fP]
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBwedge\fP reads the headers from \fIimage\fP (default: standard input) and
writes an image with the same number of lines and samples to the
standard output.  The value of each output pixel is a linear
combination of the pixel's raw line and sample coordinates.
.PP
The number of coefficients specified must be a multiple of 2, and
the number of output bands will be half the number of coefficients.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-c\fP \fIlcoef\fP,\fIscoef\fP[,\fI...\fP]
Output pixels are assigned the value:
.sp
line * \fIlcoef\fP  +  sample * \fIscoef\fP
.sp
Each pair of \fIlcoef\fP,\fIscoef\fP will be used to generate
a new output band.
.sp
.TP
\fB-n\fP \fInbits\fP
Use \fInbits\fP per output pixel (default:
log2(max(nlines,nsamps)), where nlines and nsamps are the
dimensions of \fIimage\fP).
.SH OPERANDS
.TP
[\fIimage\fP]
	image

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To produce a 512 by 512 single-band diagonal \fBwedge\fP with 8-bit pixels
increasing in intensity from the upper left corner:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	mkbih -l 512 -s 512 -f | wedge -c 1,1 -n 8
.ft R
.fi

.PP
Note that the input image can be a standalone BIH since only the
header is required.
.PP
To produce an 8-bit image with 2 \fBwedge\fP channels, the first
increasing horizontally, and the second deceasing horizontally,
sized to match an existing "image":
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	wedge -c 0,1,0,-1 -n 8 image
.ft R
.fi

.PP
To produce a 16 by 16 8-bit image varying from .5 to 1.5 vertically:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	mkbih -l 16 -s 16 -f | wedge -c 1,0 -n 8 |  \\
		scale -o div -v 15 | scale -o add -v .5
.ft R
.fi

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.TP
must specify an even number of coefficients
.br
	\fB-c must have an even number of arguments
.sp
.TP
band \fIband\fP: both coefficients cannot be 0
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
Any optional headers, other than "lq" headers, will be copied from
the input image to the corresponding bands of the output image.
