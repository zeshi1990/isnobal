.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBresamp\fP resamples (shrinks) an image by averaging pixel data, or
taking the minimum or maximum data value of the pixels to be combined.
The zoom factor must be and integer and may be independently specified
for the line and sample directions.
.PP
When combining lines or sample, counting begins at (0,0); i.e., the
first sample in the output image is an average (default), min, or max
of the first <sample_factor> samples of the first <line_factor> lines of
the input image.  The last sample of each line and last line of the
output image may not be sampled over the same number of pixels.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-l\fP \fIlfactor\fP
Resample each line \fIlfactor\fP times.
.sp
.TP
\fB-s\fP \fIsfactor\fP
Resample each sample \fIsfactor\fP times.
.sp
.TP
\fB-f\fP \fItype\fP
The function used to resample the image is \fItype\fP which
can be 'min', 'max', or 'mean' (default).
.sp
.TP
\fB-m\fP \fImask\fP
Use \fImask\fP as a mask image.  Any points in \fImask\fP that are
0 will have the corresponding points in \fIimage\fP ignored.
