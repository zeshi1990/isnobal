.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBrotate\fP uses Paeth rotation to reorient an images scan lines to
an arbitrary angle.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-a\fP \fIangle\fP
\fIimage\fP will be rotated by \fIangle\fP degrees, clockwise from
the upper left corner, in degrees.
angle must be between -45 and 45.

.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
The angle of rotation must be between -45 and 45.

.SH BUGS
.PP
The image does not have a minimal size -- the intermediate steps
often create a large image than is necessary to hold all the pixel
data.
