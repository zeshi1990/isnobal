.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBwindow\fP reads an image from \fIimage\fP (default: standard input) and
writes a specified \fBwindow\fP (subimage) to the standard output.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-b\fP \fIline\fP,\fIsamp\fP
The beginning (upper-left corner) of the \fBwindow\fP is
\fIline\fP,\fIsamp\fP (default: beginning of input image).
.sp
If only \fB-b is specified, then the \fBwindow\fP extends diagonally
from \fIline\fP,\fIsamp\fP to the last sample on the last line of
the input image.
.sp
.TP
\fB-c\fP \fIline\fP,\fIsamp\fP
The center of the \fBwindow\fP is \fIline\fP,\fIsamp\fP.  The center of
an even number of lines or samples is the larger of the two
possible values; e.g., the center line of lines 0..511 is
256, not 255.
.sp
If only \fB-c is specified, then the \fBwindow\fP is the largest
possible odd number of input lines and samples centered
on \fIline\fP,\fIsamp\fP.
.sp
.TP
\fB-e\fP \fIline\fP,\fIsamp\fP
the end (lower-right corner) of the \fBwindow\fP is \fIline\fP,\fIsamp\fP
(default: end of input image).
.sp
If only \fB-e is specified, then the \fBwindow\fP extends diagonally
from the first sample on the first line of the input image
to \fIline\fP,\fIsamp\fP.
.sp
.TP
\fB-n\fP \fInlines\fP,\fInsamps\fP
The \fBwindow\fP has \fInlines\fP lines and \fInsamps\fP samples per
line (default: remainder of image).
.sp
If only \fB-n is specified, then the \fBwindow\fP begins at the
first sample of the first line of the input image.
.PP
At least one, and no more than two, of \fB-b, \fB-c, \fB-e, and/or \fB-n
.PP
must be specified.
.TP
\fB-w\fP \fIband\fP
The arguments to \fB-b, \fB-c, and/or \fB-e are specified in the
coordinates of band \fIband\fP's \fBwindow\fP ("win") header.
.sp
.TP
\fB-g\fP \fIband\fP
The arguments to \fB-b, \fB-c, and/or \fB-e are specified in the
coordinates of band \fIband\fP's geodetic ("geo") header.
.PP
At most one of \fB-w or \fB-g may be specified.
.SH OPERANDS
.TP

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To produce a 2x enlargement of the center of a 512x512 image:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	window -c 256,256 -n 256,256 | zoom -l 2 -s 2
.ft R
.fi

.PP
To extract a 1 km by 1 km \fBwindow\fP from a 5-meter DEM, beginning
at UTM northing 4051800 and easting 349350:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	window -g 0 -b 4051800,349350 -e 4050805,350345
.ft R
.fi
.SH FILES
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     $TMPDIR/windo\fINNNNN\fP
     	Temporary copy of all input headers.
.ft R
.fi
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.TP
specified window exceeds boundaries of input image
.br
	Windows are not clipped to fit the input image.  The
	specification must be correct to start with.
.sp
.TP
no geodetic header for band \fIband\fP
no window header for band \fIband\fP
.br
	\fB-g or \fB-w was specified and there was no corresponding
	header for the specified input band.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
Input "win" and "geo" headers are transformed correctly; other
input headers are copied verbatim to the output image.
