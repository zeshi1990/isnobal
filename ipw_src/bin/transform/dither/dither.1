.SH NAME
.PP
\fBdither\fP - convert IPW image into bilevel image using ordered dithering
.SH SYNOPSIS

.ft CR
\fBdither\fP [ \fB-r\fP \fIrank\fP ] [\fIimage\fP]
.ft R

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Dither converts the input image into a bilevel (1 bit per pixel)
output image, using ordered dithering.  "Black" output pixels are
assigned the value 0; "white" output pixels are assigned the value 1.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-r\fP \fIrank\fP
Use a \fBdither\fP matrix of rank \fIrank\fP (default 4).  Possible
values are 4, 8, or 16, for simulating 16, 64, or 256 gray
levels, respectively.
.SH OPERANDS
.TP
[\fIimage\fP]
	image
		Image to be dithered
.sp
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To display "image" on a monochrome Sun workstation using a standard
version of xli (not modified to accept ipw image formats):
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	dither image | ipw2sun | xli stdin
.ft R
.fi

.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
Before using \fBdither\fP, make sure that the output device (e.g.,
Postscript printer) or display software (e.g. xv, xloadimage)
does not already incorporate a better halftoning algorithm.
