Image Transformation

  flip      - flip an IPW image
  rotate    - rotate an IPW image
  skew      - skew the lines of an IPW image
  transpose - transpose the lines and samples of an IPW image
  resamp    - resample an IPW image (decrease resolution) by averaging pixels
  window    - extract a region (window) of an IPW image
  zoom      - enlarge or reduce an IPW image by replication or subsampling
  randomize - randomly shuffle lines of an IPW image
  convolve  - perform spatial convolution on an IPW image
  fillbands - create bands between two bands using linear interpolation
  dither    - convert IPW image into bilevel image using ordered dithering
  wedge     - linear combination of line and sample coordinates
  edimg     - edit the pixels of an IPW image
