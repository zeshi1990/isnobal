.SH NAME
.PP
\fBconvolve\fP - perform spatial convolution on an IPW image
.SH SYNOPSIS

.ft CR
\fBconvolve\fP [ \fB-i\fP \fIimage\fP ] [ \fB-c\fP \fIcoefs\fP ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Convolve performs spatial convolution on an IPW image, using an
arbitrary kernel read from a file or from the standard input.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-i\fP \fIimage\fP
Use \fIimage\fP as the input image file (default: standard input).
.sp
.TP
\fB-c\fP \fIcoefs\fP
Use \fIcoefs\fP as the kernel coefficient file (default: standard
input).  This file is described in the FILES section below.
.PP
At least one of \fB-i and/or \fB-c must be specified.
.SH OPERANDS
.PP
	image (stdin)
		if the -i option is not specified
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To sharpen an image by adding it's Laplacian, reading the kernel
from the standard input:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	convolve -i image
	3 3
	0 -1 0
	-1 5 -1
	0 -1 0
.ft R
.fi
.SH FILES
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     \fIcoefs\fP
     	This is the kernel coefficient file and is given as input
     	to the program.  It is an ASCII file formatted:
     		value		description
     		-----		-----------
     		1		#rows in kernel
     		2		#columns in kernel
     		3		coefficient[0][0]
     		...		...
     		#cols+2		coefficient[0][#cols-1]
     		#cols+3		coefficient[1][0]
     		...		...
     	Values may be separated by any sequence of blanks, tabs,
     	and newlines.  If the kernel does not sum to zero, it is
     	normalized to sum to 1.0.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.TP
\fIrows\fPx\fIcols\fP kernel is bigger than \fInlines\fPx\fInsamps\fP image
.br
	The kernel cannot be bigger than the image
.sp
.TP
Sorry, only single-band input images accepted
.br
	The input image may not have more than 1 band
.sp
.TP
bad kernel size: \fIrows\fPx\fIcols\fP
.br
	The kernel dimensions must be nonzero positive integers
.sp
.TP
both kernel dimensions must be odd
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
#rows and #columns must both be odd.
.PP
There must be enough virtual memory to accommodate #rows output lines.
.PP
The normalization process can cause kernels that differ only
slightly to produce radically different results

no way of being cleanly freed.
