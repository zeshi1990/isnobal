<P>
This library is the energy-balance snowmelt model for the IPW
programs <B>snobal</B> and <B>isnobal</B>.
<P>
The library essentially runs the snow-balance model on a single point.
An IPW program calls the function "init_snow" to establish the
initial conditions for the snowpack.  The program then calls
the function "do_data_tstep" to run the snow-balance model for a
single data-time step on a single point.
<P>
The include file "snobal.h" documents the global variables that the
program uses to communicate with the library routines.
<P>
Before calling any routine in this library, the program needs
to initialize the model's constant parameters and the information
about the timesteps.  See the file "snobal.h" for list of pertinent
global variables.
