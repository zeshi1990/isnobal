/*
** NAME
**      _calc_layers -- determine # of layers in snowcover and their depths
**
** SYNOPSIS
**      #include "_snobal.h"
**
**      void
**	_calc_layers(void);
**
** DESCRIPTION
**      This routine determines the # of layers in the snowcover based its
**	depth and mass.  Usually, there are are 2 layers: the surface (active)
**	and the lower layer.  The depth of the surface layer is set to the
**	maximum depth for the surface layer (variable "max_z_s_0").  The
**	remaining depth constitutes the lower layer.  The routine checks
**	to see if the mass of this lower layer is above the minium threshold
**	(i.e., the mass threshold for the small run timestep).  If not,
**	the surface layer is the whole snowcover, and there's no lower
**	layer.
**
** GLOBAL VARIABLES READ
**	m_s
**	max_z_s_0
**	rho
**	tstep_info
**	z_s
**
** GLOBAL VARIABLES MODIFIED
**	layer_count
**	z_s
**	z_s_0
**	z_s_l
