This version of the GCTP library came from the src.related directory of the
GRASS 4.0 source code.  The version in the 'Fortran' subdirectory is from
directory /usr/packages/sparc/las/world/v2_0/baseline/source/support/geolib
of the LAS (Land Analysis System) source code.

We do not currently have the GCTP documentation from the USGS.  The projection
parameters are documented in the LAS 5.0 Programmers Manual for function
PROJON, in the "Geometric Registration Routines" chapter.
