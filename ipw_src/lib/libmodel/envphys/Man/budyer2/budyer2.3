.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBbudyer2\fP calculates sensible and latent heat exchanges using
the Businger-Dyer model for turbulent transfer.  See chapter 6 of the
reference below.  Its inputs are different than the library function
\fBbudyer\fP: this function accepts a single
wind speed at one height, and temperature and vapor pressure measurement
another at another height.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     OK      all calculations successfully completed.

     ERROR   either argument \fIe\fP or \fIe0\fP exceeds saturation vapor
             pressure at the appropriate temperature (the
             function fixes the erroneous value(s), issues
             a warning message, and proceeds with the
             calculations).
