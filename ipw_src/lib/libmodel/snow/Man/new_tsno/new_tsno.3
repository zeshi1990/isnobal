.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBnew_tsno\fP calculates a new temperature for a snow layer from its
adjusted cold content, and the layer's last (previous) temperature.
.PP
The layer's specific mass (the argument \fIspm\fP) can be computed by
multiplying the layer's thickness (m) by its density (kg/m^3).
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
snow layer's new temperature (K)
