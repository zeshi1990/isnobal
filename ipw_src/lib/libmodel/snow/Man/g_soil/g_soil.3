.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBg_soil\fP calculates the heat flow between a snow layer and the
soil accounting for both conduction and vapor transport.  See pages
45 - 47 in the reference below.
Assumes soil texture to be as in a moist sandy soil, based on
heat flux data from RMSP (A. Winstral & D. Marks, NWRC, 2003)
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
heat transfer between soil and snow (J/m^2)
