.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Given a seed point and slope and exposure data, the \fBbasin\fP function
recursively climbs "upstream", marking cells as it goes, in order to
delineate a basin.
.PP
Upstream neighbors are determinded by the exposure direction of the
current cell.
.PP
Flat regions are always considered uphill, no matter what their
orientation.  The "flat" argument allows the programmer to specify a
nonzero sin(slope) tolerance for flatness.
.PP
If an array of elevations is fed to the procedure through the
"elev" argument, then the lowest point on the boundary is computed
and returned to the calling procedure.  If "elev" is NULL, the
function returns 0.0.
.PP
\fBbasin\fP also implements clipping of the basin to a specified maximum
altitude.  If "clipFlag" is TRUE, and "elev" is non-NULL, then the
recursion stops before climbing abouve the elevation specified by
"clipElev".
.PP
The intended use of the clipping and return-the-lowest-point features
is for pit masking.  Two calls to \fBbasin\fP are to be made in the pit
masking process.  The first call delineates the entire basin starting
with the pit seed point.  The lowest point on the boundary from this
first call is then passed to a second call to \fBbasin\fP as a clipping
threshold, thus delineating only the extent of the pit.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
If an array of elevations is fed to the procedure through the
"elev" argument, then the lowest point on the boundary is computed
and returned to the calling procedure.  If "elev" is NULL, the
function returns 0.0.
