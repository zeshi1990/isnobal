\fBfpmap\fP - access fpio fpixel[pixel] map arrays
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf

#include "fpio.h"

fpixel_t **
fpmap(
	int             fd)  	|* image file descriptor	 *|

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBfpmap\fP accesses the per-band fpixel[pixel] conversion arrays associated
with file descriptor fd.
.PP
If \fBfpmap\fP is called BEFORE any floating-point header I/O has occurred
on fd, then a default pixel<->fpixel conversion will be established,
which will be unaffected by subsequent floating-point header I/O.
.PP
IPW programs use \fBfpmap\fP if they wish to modify the default
conversion(s) from pixels to fpixels.  Such programs typically read
pixels with pvread, apply the map(s) explicitly, then write fpixels
with fpvwrite.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
pointer to band-indexed array of map arrays, or NULL for error.
