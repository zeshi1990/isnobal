\fBfpmaplen\fP - access fpio fpixel[pixel] map array lengths
.SH SYNOPSIS

#include "fpio.h"

int *
fpmaplen(
	int      fd)		|* image file descriptor	 *|

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBfpmaplen\fP accesses the per-band fpixel[pixel] conversion array lengths
(i.e. number of elements in the array) associated with file descriptor
fd).
.PP
If \fBfpmaplen\fP is called BEFORE any floating-point header I/O has
occurred on fd, then a default pixel<->fpixel conversion will be
established, which will be unaffected by subsequent floating-point
header I/O.
.PP
IPW programs use \fBfpmaplen\fP, in conjunction with fpmap, if they wish to
modify the default conversion(s) from pixels to fpixels.  Such
programs typically read pixels with pvread, apply the map(s)
explicitly, then write fpixels with fpvwrite.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
pointer to band-indexed array of map array lengths, or NULL for error.
