  lqhinterp.c has a problem with reverse maps (i.e. a linear map where the
first number is greater than the second, such as pix 0->255 maps 1.0->0.0).
This shows up one the IBM RS/6000 as all the pixels being assigned values
of 0.  hor1d will show this problem.

  One solution is to use a (signed) long for a map in fpvwrite.c, just like
is used on suns.  This works, but I don't think it's a clean solution.

  Another is to fix lqhinterp.c.  This is being worked on.
