.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBlqhread\fP reads a LQH image header from file descriptor fd.  An array
of LQH_T pointers is allocated, one per band.  If a band has a LQH
header, then an LQH_T header is allocated and its address is placed
in the corresponding array element; otherwise, the corresponding
array element is NULL.
.PP
Before calling \fBlqhread\fP, the caller must verify (by calling hrname())
that a LQH header is available for ingesting.
