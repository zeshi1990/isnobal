.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Bihmake allocates a single BI header.  The header is
initialized with the remaining arguments.  If nbytes is zero,
it will be made large enough to contain nbits.  If nbits is
zero, it will be set to CHAR_BIT * nbytes.  If bihp is null,
then the per-image portion of the header is initialized from
nlines, nsamps, and nbands.  Otherwise (bihp not NULL), a link
is made to the per-image portion of *bihp.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
pointer to new BI header; NULL if error
