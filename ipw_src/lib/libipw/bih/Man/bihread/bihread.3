.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBbihread\fP reads a BIH image header from file descriptor fd.  An array
of BIH_T pointers is allocated, one per band.  If a band has a BIH
header, then an BIH_T header is allocated and its address is placed
in the corresponding array element; otherwise, the corresponding
array element is NULL.
.PP
Before calling \fBbihread\fP, the caller must verify (by calling hrname())
that a BIH header is available for ingesting.
.PP
\fBbihread\fP is called by application programs to ingest BIH headers.
.SH RETURN VALUE

pointer to array of BIH_T pointers; else NULL if EOF or error
