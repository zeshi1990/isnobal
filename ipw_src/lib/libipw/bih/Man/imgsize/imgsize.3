.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBimgsize\fP computes the total number of image data (pixel) bytes in the
image accessed via file descriptor fd.
.PP
The value returned by \fBimgsize\fP does NOT include the bytes occupied by
header data (e.g., for an image with 512 lines, 512 samples, 1 band,
and 1 byte per pixel, the value returned by \fBimgsize\fP will be 512*512).
.PP
\fBimgsize\fP is typically called by application programs that modify image
headers and then copy all image data by calling ucopy.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
total # bytes in image
