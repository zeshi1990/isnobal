** NAME
**	hnbytes -- number of bytes in image band
**
** SYNOPSIS
**	#include "bih.h"
**
**	int
**	hnbytes(
**		int             fd,	|* image file descriptor	 *|
**		int             band)	|* image band #			 *|
**
** DESCRIPTION
**	hnbytes determines the number of bytes per band in the specified band
**	of the image currently being read/written on file descriptor fd.
**
**	hnbytes may not be called before a BIH is read/written from/to fd.
**
** RETURN VALUE
**	number of bytes per band
**
** GLOBALS ACCESSED
