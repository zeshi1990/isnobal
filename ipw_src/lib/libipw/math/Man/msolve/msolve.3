.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBmsolve\fP solves a set of linear equations using matrices.  The
set contains \fIn\fP linear equations for \fIn\fP variables.  The set
represents the linear system \fIAx\fP = \fIb\fP.  This function solves this
system by Gaussian elimination and then back-substitution.
.SH RETURN VALUE
