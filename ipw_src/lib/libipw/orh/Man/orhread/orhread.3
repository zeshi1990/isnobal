.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBorhread\fP reads a ORH image header from file descriptor fd.  An array
of ORH_T pointers is allocated, one per band.  If a band has a ORH
header, then an ORH_T header is allocated and its address is placed
in the corresponding array element; otherwise, the corresponding
array element is NULL.
.PP
Before calling \fBorhread\fP, the caller must verify (by calling hrname())
that a ORH header is available for ingesting.
.PP
\fBorhread\fP is called by application programs to ingest ORH headers.
