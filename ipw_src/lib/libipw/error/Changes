Consolidated the single global variables in _errno.c, _fderr.c, and _usrerr.c
into a single file: _vars.c

Merged the file "__bug.c" into the file "_bug.c"

Instead of having each routine check for standard C by testing for the
macro "__STDC__", have the local include file "_error.h" test for the
IPW-specific macro "STANDARD_C".
