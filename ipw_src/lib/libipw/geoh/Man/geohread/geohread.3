.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBgeohread\fP reads a GEOH image header from file descriptor fd.  An array
of GEOH_T pointers is allocated, one per band.  If a band has a GEOH
header, then an GEOH_T header is allocated and its address is placed
in the corresponding array element; otherwise, the corresponding
array element is NULL.
.PP
Before calling \fBgeohread\fP, the caller must verify (by calling hrname())
that a GEOH header is available for ingesting.
.PP
\fBgeohread\fP is called by application programs to ingest GEOH headers.
.SH RETURN VALUE
