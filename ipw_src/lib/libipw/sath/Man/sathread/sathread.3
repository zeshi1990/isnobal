.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBsathread\fP reads a SATH image header from file descriptor fd.  An array
of SATH_T pointers is allocated, one per band.  If a band has a SATH
header, then an SATH_T header is allocated and its address is placed
in the corresponding array element; otherwise, the corresponding
array element is NULL.
.PP
Before calling \fBsathread\fP, the caller must verify (by calling hrname())
that a SATH header is available for ingesting.
