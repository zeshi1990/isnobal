.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBwinhread\fP reads a WINH image header from file descriptor fd.  An array
of WINH_T pointers is allocated, one per band.  If a band has a WINH
header, then an WINH_T header is allocated and its address is placed
in the corresponding array element; otherwise, the corresponding
array element is NULL.
.PP
Before calling \fBwinhread\fP, the caller must verify (by calling hrname())
that a WINH header is available for ingesting.
