.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBskewhread\fP reads a SKEWH image header from file descriptor fd.  An array
of SKEWH_T pointers is allocated, one per band.  If a band has a SKEWH
header, then an SKEWH_T header is allocated and its address is placed
in the corresponding array element; otherwise, the corresponding
array element is NULL.
.PP
Before calling \fBskewhread\fP, the caller must verify (by calling hrname())
that a SKEWH header is available for ingesting.
