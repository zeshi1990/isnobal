.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBubof\fP tests whether any I/O has been performed on file descriptor fd
since it was last u[rw]opened, i.e., are we at the Beginning Of
the File?
.PP
\fBubof\fP exists mainly to allow the hrname to reset itself after a file
descriptor has been closed and reopened.  \fBubof\fP will probably not need
to be called by IPW application programs.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
TRUE	no I/O has been performed (i.e., at beginning of file)
.PP
FALSE	I/O has been performed (not at beginning of file)
