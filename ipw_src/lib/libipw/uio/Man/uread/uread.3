.SH SYNOPSIS

uread(
	int       fd,		|* input file descriptor	 *|

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBuread\fP is a reliable interface to the UNIX read function.  It is
guaranteed to return the number of bytes requested unless end-of-file
is reached, or an I/O error occurs.
.PP
Note that the semantics of UNIX pipes are such that a normal UNIX
read may return with less than the number of bytes requested, even
when the pipe is not empty; this was the principal motivation for
\fBuread\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
>= 0	number of bytes read
.PP
ERROR	if failure
