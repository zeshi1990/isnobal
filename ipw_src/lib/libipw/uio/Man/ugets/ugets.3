.SH NAME
.PP
\fBugets\fP - read a line from a UNIX file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
#include "ipw.h"

char *
ugets(
	int      fd,		|* input file descriptor	 *|
	char    *buf,		|* -> input buffer		 *|
	int      nbytes)	|* #bytes to read		 *|

.ft R

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBugets\fP reads bytes from fd into buf, until any of the following are
true:
.PP
-- nbytes-1 bytes have been read and transferred to buf
-- a newline character ('\\n') has been read and transferred to buf
-- an end-of-file condition is encountered on fd
.PP
An EOS character ('\\0') is placed after the last byte transferred to
buf (i.e., on return, buf will be a null-terminated C string).
.PP
\fBugets\fP is analogous to the UNIX stdio routine fgets.
.PP
Use \fBugets\fP for efficient input of ASCII text (e.g., image headers)
from IPW data files.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
buf	The read was successful.
.PP
NULL	An error occurred or end-of-file was encountered.
