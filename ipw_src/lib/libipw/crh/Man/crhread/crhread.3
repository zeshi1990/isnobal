.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBcrhread\fP reads a CRH image header from file descriptor fd.  An array
of CRH_T pointers is allocated, one per band.  If a band has a CRH
header, then an CRH_T header is allocated and its address is placed
in the corresponding array element; otherwise, the corresponding
array element is NULL.
.PP
Before calling \fBcrhread\fP, the caller must verify (by calling hrname())
that a CRH header is available for ingesting.
