.SH BUGS
.PP
crhsort expects a *CRH_T, while we pass in a *CLASS.  This is wrong,
but I'm not sure I want to fix it.  It should blow up, but it seems
to work, so I won't muck with it now.  Dana Jacobsen, ERL-C.
.PP
Well, I've decided to muck with it.  Hopefully, the fix won't blow
up.  J. Domingo, OSU, 29 May 1996
