\fBim2html\fP - convert IPW man page into new (HTML) man page
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBim2html\fP converts the IPW man page for an IPW command or
library function to the
new HTML version of an IPW man page.  The new man page is written to
standard output.  The conversion is generally not 100% complete, so
the new IPW man page will require some minor editing.  This editing
can be done with a text editor if the user is familiar with HTML, or
it can be done with a HTML editor such as Netscape Navigator Gold.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-f\fP
The man page is for an IPW library function (default: IPW command).
There are some differences in the section headings for these two types
of man pages.
.sp
.TP
\fB-c\fP \fIfile\fP
The source code file \fIfile\fP contains the man page to be converted
in its comments.  Before converting, first extract the man page from the
file.  Those lines starting with "**" are assumed to be part of the man
page.
.SH OPERANDS
.TP
\fIname\fP
The name of the IPW command whose man page should be converted.
If no name is specified, im2html reads a man page from standard input.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To convert the man page of the IPW command "foo", enter this
command:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     im2html foo > foo.man
.ft R
.fi
.PP
The same conversion can be done this way too:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     ipwman foo | im2html > foo.man
.ft R
.fi
.PP
If the file xyz.c contains the source code for the library routine xyz
as well as its man page in the file's comments, then to extract and convert
the man page, enter:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
   im2html -f -c xyz.c > xyz.man
.ft R
.fi
.SH FILES
.PP
None.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS

.TP
Warning: skipping unknown section: \fIsection\fP
The man page for the specified command contained a section that this
utility does not recognize, and therefore, skipped.  The user may wish
to examine the original man page to determine what to do about the
skipped section (e.g., include its information in another section).

.TP
Error: Cannot access file "\fIfile\fP"
The file specified by the \fB-c\fP option is not really a file, or
is not readable.
.sp
.TP
Error:  Cannot access "ipwman" command
\fBim2html\fP could not invoke the \fBipwman\fP command on the given
name.  A possible cause is that the user's path does not include the
directory where \fBipwman\fP is located.

Modified so this command would invoke "ipwman" instead of
having to pipe the output of "ipwman" into this command.
