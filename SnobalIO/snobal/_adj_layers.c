/*
** NAME
**      _adj_layers -- adjust the layers because of new snowcover depth
**
** SYNOPSIS
**      #include "_snobal.h"
**
**      void
**	_adj_layers(void);
**
** DESCRIPTION
**      This routine adjusts the layers of the snowcover because the
**	snowcover's depth has changed.  It is assumed that the snowcover's
**	density has already been updated.  The # of layers are recomputed
**	based on the overall snowcover depth.  Their depths and masses
**	are updated as well.  If a layer has been created due to an
**	increase in the snowcover's depth, its temperature and cold content
**	are initialized. 
**
** GLOBAL VARIABLES READ
**	layer_count
**
** GLOBAL VARIABLES MODIFIED
**	cc_s
**	cc_s_0
**	cc_s_l
**	h2o
**	h2o_max
**	h2o_total
**	h2o_vol
**	m_s
**	m_s_0
**	m_s_l
**	rho
**	T_s
**	T_s_0
**	T_s_l
**
**	(and those variables modified by "_calc_layer" and "_layer_mass")
